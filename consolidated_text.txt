hello everyone a very good morning to  all of you  wonderful to have you with us on this  journey where we explore everything on  cloud computer on sorry edge computing  my name is diksha nirukan and i lead  nascom's cloud advocacy program  this webinar is a collaboration between  nascom insights and the nascom cloud  advocacy program  nasscom insights is the research arm of  nasscom and we publish multiple reports  every month on various technology topics  the most recent one that we published  just about last week  was around the air adoption index and  the ai game changers 2022 which is a  compendium of ai innovation stories  these reports and many other reports are  available on our community website i'll  share the link on the chat window  sometime soon  please feel free to explore this and the  other reports that we release  the nascom cloud advocacy program is a  platform that aims to bring together the  entire cloud ecosystem for continuous  conversations on cloud computing and the  value that it can bring to businesses  throughout the year we'll be conducting  multiple programs events webinars  roundtable discussions leader talks and  more to highlight different aspects of  cloud computing  covering the technology side and the end  user enterprise side as well  today's webinar on edge computing is one  such program  we visited this topic three years ago  when edge computing was just taking off  and we are revisiting it today to better  understand what has changed especially  since the pandemic how mature is edge  computing and sorry edge adoption today  what are some of the emerging  opportunities and what are some of the  important challenges that need to be  addressed  before we begin here are some  housekeeping rules  all of you will be on you through the  duration of the webinar should you have  any questions please please put these up  only on the question and answer panel  please not on the chat panel  if you wish to direct any question to a  specific panelist please mention their  name as well  i will try and take few of these  questions after their discussion and if  time permits if not then i will work  with the panelists to share their inputs  with all of you at later date  i will also share links to our reports  on edge computing that we did in 2019  and 2020 please feel free to  let's begin the downl  to share the  perspectives i have today for subject  matter experts from different aspects of  edge computing system integrators  solution providers and communications to  start with i have ajay paltry associate  vice president of india technologies  welcome ajay  uh thank you diksha for the introduction  good morning  next we have karthik sabasin business  consultant from tcs  hi katy good morning  good morning thanks  rajesh  vice president and global head of  managed hosting and cloud services data  communications  hi diksha and happy to be part of this  discussion  and finally sanjeev  vice president technology and  architecture global logic hi good  morning everyone and i'm very excited to  be here i'm sure that we will have a lot  of fun in this discussion  keep keeping the questions  thanks  thanks to all the panelists  uh i want to kick start this discussion  with the quest few questions around you  know overview of what has been happening  like i said in edge computing  uh so what are some of the broad trends  that you are saying uh seeing in this  space how is the adoption of edge  computing accelerating especially since  the pandemic i want to start with  karthik i think if you can first just  briefly introduce yourself and then take  the question  yeah sure direction  myself tech  i am i'm part of  tcs i'm working as a business consultant  uh currently i am leading  uh edge computing and ml operation coe  uh under cognitive business operation  unit for these things  i have overall like 15 plus experience  mostly in telecom domain and other  domains  to start with uh  when it comes to broad trends right the  edges  wide  is wider  so we have seen organizations uh  shifting uh towards cloud services uh in  past  where it is almost a homogeneous or a  centralized and scalable environment  past pandemic  a new trend of cloud adoption is getting  emerged  like more of like hybrid and multi-code  kind of an environment  it is becoming a de facto standard for  organizations uh to go towards  multi-cloud and hybrid cloud  when i say hybrid uh it is no more  a cloud private cloud or public cloud or  a  data center hosted by the organization  it is getting extended towards the  infrastructure at the edge  so  when i say edge or age computing it is  it is more about bringing the compute  storage and network uh  near to the data source or where the  data is getting generated  uh so we see like edge is going to be a  driving force  for the  in future for the compute world  so we see a lot of adoptions of edge  computing especially in  manufacturing retail  utility automobiles and agriculture and  especially in mobility sectors  where telcos are  bringing their capabilities or  network-centric capabilities especially  in  multi-access or make kind of a  infrastructure into this domain  though there are a lot of uh  benefits that edge brings right some of  the benefits are latency low latency  high bandwidth  uh kind of uh  and many more  latency is seen as the  major benefit for enterprises to adopt  edge computing  uh for their use cases  uh and the typical workloads what we see  that has been into production  is mostly on a a kind of a workload and  some kind of a control logic  workloads but  we are seeing a lot of pocs and proof of  values uh kind of uh use cases  uh in ar via spaces uh in mobility  spaces of drones or automated guided  vehicles  uh so  so in a nutshell we can tell like uh  currently the total compute of the  cloud uh  public cloud service is higher but  sooner or later the total compute that  edge computing technology is going to  provide  will go over uh overrule the total  compute of cloud services  so that is my taker  thank you  very much  yeah hi um so i'm rajesh avasthi i head  the cloud and hosting business for  product communication  i've been in industry for 30 plus years  in various roles from technology  delivery  technology  architecting  sales business development and product  management functions  uh happy to be part of this discussion  i've seen industry evolving over a  period of time  and most of the things that we have seen  are driven by the use cases which  various industry verticals are looking  for  and in that sense what we have seen  as the data volumes have grown  where we see the  velocity of data increasing we see the  veracity of data coming in from various  sources  uh the requirement is also becoming  important to see that we have  models where you process data closer to  where it is getting generated and with  industrial iot  becoming pervasive we will see this  going manifold further and that's where  we will see that more and more things  will be computed  near to the  location where the data is getting  generated  and there would be use cases which would  uh require low latency or a lower round  trip  accessibility those use cases need to be  closer to where the data is getting  consumed and that's where we see that  distributed cloud model is going to  become a pervasive  solution deployment from that we've seen  with hyperscalers like aws azure and  google things are getting consolidated  to the central sides um but certain use  cases which would need this kind of  capability which i was talking about i  think  edge is going to become very relevant in  that sense and we see that happening in  various industry verticals where  customers are looking for use cases  where they want to deploy compute nearer  to where they want to consume that  and data which is very important and has  to be  kept for historical reasons or for to be  processed on a central site is something  which would be sent to the cloud  environment so that's going to be a  technology trend that we will see over a  period of time  we see with cloud  getting the flexibility and the scale  that you wanted was uh becoming  important uh but with edge uh getting  added to that we will see a distributed  cloud deployment and that's something  which we have seen in some of the  industry verticals like communication  retail and other particles as well  so those are some of the things which i  believe are going to become very  important in the course of time  i'll touch upon the  distributed part of it later but ajay  over to you  yeah uh thank you diksha for giving me a  chance to express my thoughts on this  platform uh just introducing myself in  short uh my name is ajay palker and i'm  working as an avp in winter technologies  from last three plus years  uh winged has been in in this industry  from 18 plus years of having worked in  fintech mobility solutions iot  aiml successfully delivering blockchain  applications and methods  uh i personally have 11 plus years of  experience and uh  you know in this interest and i've  worked in crm market research bfss  segment and more  so uh  talking about the broad trends and you  know adoption of edge computing all  together  uh you know firstly you need to  understand that you know it's computing  market growth uh if you compare from uh  you know 2017 to 21 uh it has grown to a  compound annual growth rate of more than  35 percent approximately  uh around 10 percent of enterprise uh  generated data is created  and processed outside the traditional uh  you know centralized data center or  cloud  and uh gartner predicts that by 2025 uh  this figure would reach out you know up  to 75 percent uh as well so uh key  driving factors are the you know advent  of uh industrial  ideas rajesh actually mentioned  the physio networks and  you know increase  in the number of intelligent  applications  and uh you know growing load of that on  cloud infrastructure all together so  this this all signs indicate that 2022  uh you know will be a private year for  edge computing altogether so uh  also talking about broad trends  uh you know that we are seeing uh we can  see a good growth in industrial sectors  uh manufacturing  uh industrial process monitoring  uh  you know predictive maintenance all  together uh autonomous vehicles uh even  the smallest things like charging  stations uh there's transportation uh  healthcare smart homes smart cities  smart buildings uh and you know a lot  more things going on  can you bring me to my second question  uh related question is  uh in terms of use cases  how are the use cases of edge deployment  evolving  again from a pandemic perspective right  if you look at cloud computing we have  seen a lot of acceleration in cloud  adoption during the pandemic so are you  seeing that reflected in edge  deployments as well  and which are some of the verticals that  are leading the adoption of  edge computing and if you can you know  give us examples both from  indian enterprise perspective and the  global perspective that will be good and  for this question i want to start with  sanjeev  sure  again good morning everyone i'm sanjeev  i had the architecture practice uh in  global logic in addition to the  architecture practice i also  uh lead the uh the metaverse coe and the  low code notebooks you as well in global  logic so that's about me uh yes so  you're right so the as far as the uh the  uh the in the edge computing adoption  and the the things are changing into the  vertical uh automotive is one of the  great example that we can tell and uh  and if we talk about the india right now  the mahindra has actually already  uh put the a das feature into the xuv  700 right that's a classic example  though the level the maturity may not be  that level that like we are talking for  the autonomous car uh but that is the  that's a the the the start of that you  know innovation is happening in india as  well  so uh typically if we take the  automotive as an example right so  in the past typically we have 50 to 60  uh you know sensors on on on a car on a  connected car which is now increased to  100 plus and now it is keep more adding  more more and more uh sensor on board  onto the on to the on to the car itself  right which may generate huge amount of  data now in terms of connected cars if  it is connecting to the  uh to the to the central cloud and uh  you know sending huge amount of data  latency would be a big problem so how  the and this is where the edge computing  can  rightly fit into that where  the uh the data can be collected at the  source itself the decision can be uh can  be uh can be made at the at the vehicle  level especially from that uh the the  context of your information if i'm  driving a car and i need to know that  who is  going uh your nearer far from me and i  need to make the decision faster and if  you go everything for the central cloud  it would be it would be mess right and  that is where the classic example and  i'm sure that in the next three to five  years we will see lot of innovation in  this area and india would be leading  that because innovation  happens at a scale in india i am very  very positive that that will happen and  the intelligent solutions like  the equalization avoidance traffic  routing uh io flow detection for example  right and then  giving indication understanding the  behavior of the driver for example right  the those kind of  aspects of the use cases can be built  because now we have  exponential ai ml exposure we have a  compute we have a very uh oe uh from the  infrastructure standpoint people are  building lightweight uh battery  optimized uh  the the hardware devices which is on  boarded onto the on to the connected  cars or the autonomous so i think a lot  of things are happening and that's why  cloud uh  being a  distributed nature of the the edge  computing is is making it uh making it  uh possible as well as  5g is also coming so that we the vehicle  can be connected to the  mobile uh edge computing and the they  can process the data they don't need to  have everything on board as well so a  lot of innovations are happening in this  area  your inputs in terms of  edge deployments and also if the  panelists can also indicate  what is the  maturity in terms of how much of the  edge deployment sustained poc versus how  much of it is  commercialization  and that would also give an indication  of how mature this industry is overall  yeah sure  from my perspective like the pandemic  right the pandemic has accelerated a lot  of transformations uh digital as well as  in technology  uh  the lot of use cases that was uh built  specific to address the challenges of  pandemic  is going to be permanent in nature as  the customers as well as enterprise sees  value in it  uh it is going to be permanent and  previously those use cases were driven  by cloud services with limited  components on it  but uh slowly we are seeing the shift  many organizations are shifting their  focus towards edge native use cases uh  complemented by the cloud services right  especially in pharma manufacturing we  know a lot of changes has happened  in manufacturing specifically uh with  industry 4.0 and digital factory kind of  an initiative  we see a lot of use cases that are  enabled by edge  the itot integration is the main  priority for any manufacturing global  view of assets  whatever happening in the  on the real-time monitoring of their  assets  preventive maintenance a lot of  analytical use cases data gathering itot  integrations are happening at the  manufacturing level  from manufacturing perspective we have  seen lot of  ai kind of use cases and data analytical  use cases getting deployed and they have  moved beyond pocs and they are into  productions  still certain use cases on mobility like  agvs and any computer vision use cases  are in  mvp stages  but the organization intention we can  see that uh it has to be productionized  not only for a single factory  uh from a global strategy perspective  they want to scale it up to multiple  factories so they are looking for an  infrastructure uh from that perspective  not a piecemeal kind of an approach to  for a particular use case  at a global level how they can leverage  their data analytics and other stuffs to  bring value to the production  efficiency and the documentation  [Music]  yeah see  again various verticals are in different  stages when you talk about from an  adoption perspective if i go to your  question  specifically from india perspective  where are we whether we are in the poc  stage or are we in actual commercial  deployment so it depends on industry  vertical to vertical and also it depends  on the use case that you are picking up  okay um i'll possibly take example of  two industry verticals which i see uh  happening and yes there are others also  if you talk about uh telecom industry uh  telecom industry if you look at it and  i'm talking of b2b telecom not b2c  telephone  industry that we look at  uh two areas where we would see  adoption of edge computing being adopted  one area is when  5g is going to be  becoming an enabler for the enterprises  when they would deploy private 5g not  the 5g in the telco world  um i see that edge computing is going to  play a big role in that the  devices which need to be everything is  becoming a software defined today  so these would be deployed on the edge  nodes which would would be deployed in  the enterprise private 5g  deployments the other area that we will  see  and which is already happening  is on the sd-wan space  where most of the application or the  controllers are deployed on these  standardized compute so you no longer  have appliances uh being deployed there  and these are deployed on appliances on  which you can have various workloads  also so you see  sd van deployment and in in conjunction  with that you also see  uh secure access on the service edge  that you would create so sasi is going  to be deployed  we've already seen production  deployments of cdn network on the  network side where content is getting  delivered so these are production  systems which are very much in use  and are having the commercial  deployments also if i go to retail  specifically in retail if you look at it  i think in india specifically we are in  a poc stage or a stage where people are  looking at use cases  one one such use cases people are  talking about is the use of here we are  for  looking at the customer behavior and  then deciding how they would want to  kind of take it  forward from that and that's where the  edge deployment use cases are being  considered pocs are being done by some  of the retail customers  looking at inventory management is going  to be enabled by the edge devices  looking at the volumes that you are  talking of so those are some of the use  cases which i see in these two verticals  if i have to talk about  where we see  adoption of edge computing being taken  into account but one of the things which  we have seen is because when you are  talking about rolling out this in a  large scale  uh manageability from a central console  both from orchestration perspective  and monitoring and management  perspective is going to become very key  enabler for this technology to be used  for those kind of use cases because if  you're talking of retail and if you have  a retail company which has  thousands of stores or maybe thousands  or tens of thousands of store uh having  the workforce to manage this kind of a  deployment and monitor and manage that  is going to become a big challenge for  uh the  industry so having the central control  is going to become very important in my  view and that's something which is uh  which will be the enabler for  this getting utilized more and more by  other industry verticals as well  thanks  and i'll touch upon even the 5g aspect  and the  because those two i think together will  be a big boost for its computing and  adoption yeah yeah sure go ahead sanji  yeah one thing actually i just wanted to  add uh is that like now  uh there is very interested uh  interesting actually concept is now  implemented in the vehicle to everything  right so instead of on boarding the  devices onto the onto the on the onto  the vehicle itself you can actually have  that environment so basically your road  your your roads are actually equipped  with those devices  and i believe that some prototype is  happening uh i think uh mr gutkari has  mentioned something uh in one of his  speech that right now they are doing a  poc where instead of onboarding all the  devices uh sensors on the on the vehicle  itself uh the road is equipped with that  so you you don't need to have a huge  investment on that one onto the vehicle  so you can leverage that edge nodes all  together which is connecting to your  vehicle so vehicle to vehicle vehicle to  environment vehicle to road vehicle to  traffic and that kind of innovation is  happening so there's a very big concept  the the  the revolutionized concept it is  happening so i i highly recommend that  audience to  go and explore that and global logic has  recently done some innovation area uh  some pocs as well uh not in india but  outside uh so that's a very uh good  concept for us to explore as well we do  v2x  the smart roads concept in a way  are they over to you  yeah um so see um kovid19 will push more  companies to the edge we all know that  so we all know that you know cloud  computing has been receiving the line  share of attention throughout the global  pandemic and as we are heading toward uh  you know the third year there's a shift  from edge computing to its cloud at this  moment so uh talking about you know the  industrial verticals and uh you know  different uh you know approaches that  has been taken right from uh  you know we have been uh in this uh  pandemic working with a lot of different  industrial segments right from uh you  know manufacturing  uh  in bfsi as well uh in uh you know  construction industry and we've also  deployed certain things in farming and  you know  greenhouse uh you know verticals all  together so uh  when when when i say uh you know bfsi we  have done certain pocs as well as we  have deployed uh you know certain uh  projects as well so edge computing has  helped you know the customers to  uh you know fight against the issues at  the transaction side or you know  recognize the user while onboarding uh  this is what i'm talking specifically  into the retail banking new banking or  you know the fintech space as well so um  i'm currently working on retail uh  real-time uh you know uh facial  recognition for smooth customer  onboarding  uh fraud detection and prevention all  together so uh we are using face  liveness check uh you know comparison uh  uh we're doing with the captured  lightness picture  uh with the identification documents uh  at the atms uh you know uh in the cctv  you can uh use the facial recognition uh  in real time to detect potential fraud  uh uh you know you can  block down the atms you can alert the  customers the banks uh and uh you know  even the cops uh to prevent the crime  all together  uh  in manufacturing uh specifically uh we  are solving certain challenges like uh  you know incorporating internal  information uh uh including workflow uh  energy uh you know expertise data as  well as external contextual logistics  like uh you know geolocation  uh  the partner information the supply chain  uh and environmental inputs as well so  we connect manufacturers to both  structured and unstructured data uh  generated on the factory flows uh acting  on insights closer to where the data is  created uh which improves the production  quality enhances the operations uh  boost the kpi performance and  you know you can you know proactively  make certain decisions  i want to  now touch upon what rajesh  spoke about which is 5g  and bring in the aspect of matter was  also to understand  how are these two factors influencing  each computer rajesh i know you touched  upon it briefly  but if you can give us a more broader  view about  private 5g and if i can call it public  5g how is that evolving again  both from a global perspective we know  in the u.s there's a lot of uh advances  in private fighting that's happening and  acceleration is also increasing but what  about the rest of the world and what  about specifically  for india  how are these two panning out and how  will they play a key role in  edge computing and also the role of  metaphors  because i see that being very integral  to  i mean edge being very integral to  metals  so rajesh  5g is going to become an enabler for a  lot of things when we are talking of  things which would have augmented  reality or virtual reality and that's  where you're talking about meta what's  also coming into picture and when you  talk of here we are  you're talking about uh  an experience which should be a  lifelike experience and when you're  talking of life like experience  what you would want is that the  capabilities are such that it gives you  performance which is more real life like  and that's where i think  both edge computing  and 5g is going to be an enabler because  5g would give us the speed at which you  will be able to consume data from  various and i'm talking from a general  not even on only from a private 5g  perspective but also otherwise also but  there won't be certain workloads which  would need computing and if you're  talking about gaming as one such example  where people want real life like  experience today  then it has to be closer to where it is  getting consumed otherwise you'll be  getting data from or  sending data to a centralized location  which could be a cloud and that's where  you see  edge becoming a very pervasive part of  that solution  so in my view both edge and 5g is going  to be an enabler 5g from a perspective  that it would allow huge amounts of data  to be accessible at a speed which would  give real life like experience  uh edge from the perspective whatever  can be  localized and can be customized for a  certain segment of people or a  demography  it can be done  in on the edge computing side but all  this has to be  basically controlled from a central  location and that's something which is  going to make it more pervasive  so what in my view one of the challenges  which would be there when we want to  make it more  accessible for various use cases how do  you make sure that the entire ecosystem  becomes an enabler  and you have the right skill set to  manage that ecosystem that you have to  enable to create a use case  in my view edge is going to be more  driven by use cases than by technology  technology would be used for a specific  use case like what sanjay was talking  about if you're talking of a moving  devices like cars or automotive industry  use case is very different whereas when  you go to the retail where a customer  comes into a store which is a fixed  store the use case is very different  that you're talking about so uh use  cases will  uh decide what technology components and  how they would be integrated and that's  how we will see so 5g and edge computing  in that sense is going to work hand in  hand so they would be working in  conjunction to create that use cases for  our customers and  a better  user experience for our customers  and the method was rajesh how  i spoke about augmented reality is going  to become a part of metaverse because  you're talking of  a verse which is going to be  more artificial you would want  artificial intelligence to be part of  that  you would want more people talking about  that  and and using that in a business context  is going to  be something which would be coming over  a period of time i think today metaverse  is being spoken about in certain  industry vertical areas only it has more  of a  i would say it is in a stage where  people are excited about it uh gaming is  one area obviously where metaverse is  going to play a big this thing but  that's more of a b2c  how does it pan out in b2b scenario is  something which we would have to see i  see  uh some usage of that in form of what we  started off as the chatbots  i think they would become more  enabled on the  on the video side and artificial  intelligence would play a big role in  that particular space so it would evolve  over a period of time but at this point  in time in my view uh the use cases are  more b to c than p to b we'll see more  of that coming into b to b space  i'm exploring doing another either a  panel discussion on metaverse and  online gaming and cloud so hopefully  that should also happen sometimes  yeah um so see uh the role of 5g uh in  edge computing uh as rajesh has  you know explained that it goes  uh hand in hand uh you know the 5g  deployment and the age computing  altogether so uh i was just reading an  article from erickson digital uh so as  far as 5g is concerned uh it does  forecasted that by 2023 uh you know more  than 1 billion 5g devices will be  connected worldwide all together  so organizations uh you know are  investing in 5g to streamline you know a  lot of things like data collection  power the iot devices  enhance digital experiences all together  so under optimal conditions 5g  you know is about 10 times faster uh as  we have seen so but  while fighting can provide fast local  connectivity  uh the technology doesn't account for  commute or storage at this time so that  is why uh you know uh the cloud  computing uh it's basically uh you know  h2 cloud and 5g becomes a mediator there  uh most business still run on supporting  functions uh you know through a central  uh data center at this moment and which  creates latency and reduces network  performances all together  so 5g obviously is going to be a boost  there uh  looking forward you know more companies  will augment 5g deployments with edge  computing this approach can reduce  latency and help companies generate  stronger roi  uh from these rollouts uh the edge  computing also  uh helps uh with use cases like virtual  and uh augmented uh reality  uh altogether and uh as uh you know  rightly said self-driving cars uh which  require uh you know processing of  heavy amounts of data  uh in real time and uh you know  including the minimal latency altogether  so yeah this is uh the take on 5g  when it comes to edge computing  okay so moving on to the second thing  that we identified which is the cloud  and edge continuum right and again i  want to start with rajesh because you  touched upon orchestration  and  security uh how do you see cloud  computing evolved with edge computing  right basically the question of  centralized to decentralize and what are  the possible implications in terms of  you know architecture complexity like  you said orchestration access and  security data processing etc  rajesh can you  share your insights  sure  see again um as i told you edge is going  to be driven more by use cases  uh and as we are talking about data  getting generated from various sources  and being processed closer to the source  by the edge devices or the edge  compute or a cloud setup that you may  have closer to  the data source  there would still be need to have a  consolidated view of data as well  either for getting insights in a broader  sense  or also making sure that you have  historical data also which is there so  you will see  uh data and and i think  in analytics world people have been  using  that which is the etl function which is  you extract data you transform data and  then you use it for a specific use case  in my view edge is going to become more  like an enabler from an extraction and  transformation perspective and use it in  some form localized in that area but  eventually if you want to get a larger  or a broader view from the data which is  coming from various edge sources you  will have to have a consolidated uh  deployment also and that's where you see  most of the cloud providers are today  talking about edge computing being an  extension of the cloud setups which they  have uh and and that's where you see  they are saying that  we'll be able to give the same  technology which you have consumed in  your cloud environment  and be deployed closer to the source of  data for creating the use case which you  want that is one  one of the things which we have seen and  karthik can add more from a technology  perspective  i see kubernetes is becoming a de facto  standard when you're talking about  orchestration across environments  more and more applications are getting  modernized and when we are talking about  these use cases  uh on the edge computing in my view  these are going to be cloud native use  cases that means they would be using  some of the technologies which are being  used in the cloud arena  so orchestrating them through kubernetes  or k8s  is going to become the standard and  that's where i think you see most of the  hyperscalers are also talking about  their edge footprint being orchestrated  through kubernetes  uh making it easier for people to manage  it and also make sure that there is some  amount of standardization although there  is no standardization as of now  on these worlds that's where we see both  both areas kind of merging into this and  that's where we why i was saying that it  is going to become an  extension of distributed cloud so  earlier what we did was we had data  centers we consolidated those data  centers into cloud deployments now we  are saying for certain use cases you may  want to use the same technology closer  to the source of data and process it and  get an outcome of that from that on a  real-time basis  and that's something which would be  enabled by the edge cloud computing area  and that's where we see distributed  systems coming up  yeah  us rajasthani said  edges  is growing in many forms every time  starting from device uh to near age  forage regional age or towards the  footage to cloud architecture is  becoming is a complex thing  so the intelligent orchestration or  automation is going to be critical in  managing edge devices  so  we see lot of  technologies on self  diagnosing  or self monitoring and self healing kind  of capabilities  in order to manage such large scale of  devices  where they should not incline towards  any manual interventions uh kind of a  thing  apart from that like uh uh the security  is going to be a critical aspect uh it  has uh edges and layered architecture  right it may be top to bottom  uh the  security itself is evolving in different  domains they have a different trust from  these threat vectors  uh  there are different approaches by  different organization for security may  be a monitoring alert or vulnerability  assessment  risk mitigation kind of an approach  so those complexities  are there  in a short like the heterogeneity or  heterogeneous environment is going to  define edge in the future  so any centralized or unified  orchestration or a management plan you  should be able to handle  such heterogeneous it may start with a  small  gateway device or a small sensor device  to a hyper converged infrastructure kind  of a device  uh again in application perspective it  may be as registered it may be a  containerized or a physical or it can be  a  docker base or a kubernetes based  applications so the management plane  should handle such complexities in  managing monitoring  securely onboarding those devices  rollout of devices patches over the air  update  there are multiple complexities that  should be considered while deploying it  yeah  so see uh i'll rightly jump on to the  edge containers that we are actually  discussing at this moment  uh  so you know looking uh it's it's one of  the trends uh which is going on uh  so  uh  software containers which are deployed  at the age of the network uh along with  uh orchestration platforms like  kubernetes uh containerization uh you  know involves packaging applications you  know in a way  that uh you know isolate software and  its dependencies from other components  and containers are highly portable uh  lightweight which make them easy to  deploy and maintain all together so you  can use them in public private or you  know hybrid cloud environments uh uh you  know all together uh itself so  uh you know an organization uh you know  i'll just take an example uh generate  data from internet of thing uh uh  internet iot devices uh smart sensors  and other devices on the edge of the  network so this data must be collected  stored and processed so in order to  extract business insights from this data  it must flow seamlessly between edges  clouds data centers  and uh using a wide variety of work  locations and involvement altogether uh  so we need to  uh you know take care of uh you know  architecture right from uh the inflow of  of the data load balancing and uh  obviously from the security aspects  itself  uh the devices and sensors are where  information is collected process  or maybe both of them is done they have  just enough bandwidth uh you know you  need to see that memory the processing  capability all together so uh we'll also  need to take care of uh scaled scale  you know if you can scale down  uh on premises edge servers or data  centers and which can be easily moved  and fit into a comparatively you know  smaller remote locations all together so  flexibility and scalability are  necessities uh uh you know at this  moment what enterprise needs uh in order  to change and  [Music]  uh you spoke about  uh  security orchestration kubernetes  containers etc and that brings me to one  of the most important points from an  edge computing perspective which is  talent right so what kind of skills  would need to be developed  for an edge environment and that's  mainly because we are seeing a  convergence of  edge cloud telecom networking hardware  software applications right  so are the skills mutually exclusive  when you form a team or are there a fair  bit of cross killing that is required  what is your approach to talent  development when it comes to  edge computing  i think let us continue with you  sure  so uh see the first thing to understand  uh uh you know is that edge computing  has not uh you know evolved uh in a  vacuum all together so  uh it does not refer to a single uh  technology uh uh you know at this moment  so uh it's an  overall architectural concept  uh related to a  larger paradigm you can call it as  distributed computing altogether uh in  which uh you know you the computing  resources are spread throughout a system  rather than a centralized uh in a sort  of a master controller or an application  you can say so among leading skills that  are required i would broadly uh you know  categorize into different segments uh  first it comes  you know as a part of a system design so  you need someone uh you know as a skill  who can understand how everything fits  together  uh the edge devices the uh you know the  networks uh the software systems it's  helpful to understand you know some  common data exchange formats like uh you  know json and how to process and  organize data efficiently in  collaboration between many devices  uh second i would uh bring in networking  so when working with edge computing  system if engineer understands how to  measure and manage  the  performance of you know computer  networks  uh implementing efficient communication  protocols  uh there's mqtt  which can further reduce uh you know  bandwidth demand  so  that is one of the skills now uh you  know as you're moving uh towards um you  know  uh the importance of data storage and  analysis uh you'll also uh you know the  third thing that i'll bring in is a need  of database expertise all together uh  you know as a skill set  uh  another thing which i would highlight is  from the security aspect so you know  physical  uh and cyber security cannot be taken  for granted uh you know when the data is  stored uh  when the data is stored accessed or you  know managed all together so uh we need  to understand the function of  implementation of network security uh  you know devices like firewalls um  or maybe you know data protection  features like uh authentication uh  encryption and certifications all  together  so uh yeah yeah you know we have uh  people of all the backgrounds to see  themselves represented and included uh  you know in our work all together when  we work in venture so we actively seek  to diversify our team uh into the broad  spectrums that i've introduced and  bring more voices to the tables all  together  when it comes to easy  sanji  yeah sure  so uh thanks i think rj has uh brought  up very good point on the three or four  areas the core skills so i would divide  it into two pieces altogether one is the  foundational skill and second is the  add-on screen so when it comes to the  foundation sales  the the edge computing is all about  distributed paradigm right so how  actually you can design the system and  that require a different dimension your  communication uh point to point  connectivity how your mess what are the  messaging protocol that you're using so  typically that you need a broader  spectrum of that someone who understand  the system design or into the  distributed environment right and it  covers all the aspects like  cap theorem and decap theorem and all  the stuff right that is one area uh the  second area again the again the core  piece is the network and you understand  the protocols for example right so uh  there are very uh good uh you know areas  to explore in terms of how actually  communication works actually right how  computers work sold together and these  are the by the way foundational skills  right typically we have seen that many  people  you know miss these kind of foundational  skills which is typically part of your  software engineering uh you know a  courseware right and that is second area  third is because uh it's all about  generating data and and  you should have a analytical mindset you  know what the data should be processed  how the data should be optimized what  are different dimensions we need to look  into the data that is third all right  and the horizontal would be more of a  security at the end you know  other than that these are the foundation  skills which aj has already touched upon  that other than that  uh two more areas that i would highly  recommend to be uh to build that skill  is that number is the the edge native  which is based on the cloud native  principle site  so you should have a good understanding  of the cloud native architecture or the  edge native architecture your devops  skills for example which is again  because like uh you know  rajesh mentioned that the orchestration  deploying manageability of the the  distributed ecosystem is very very  complex area and the that's why the the  capabilities like sre site reliability  engineering those capabilities are  evolved and that's where you the  operation architecture standpoint you  need to consider those factors other  than that the add-on skill would be like  we have a linux foundation uh you know  there's an organization actually who are  working on many iot iot uh kind of edge  frameworks uh that is that is good  interesting a good area to explore  because that  that is is it is a amalgamation of your  micro service architecture your uh you  know devops architecture your uh cross  cutting concerns what are the core  capabilities required for a distributed  application scalable flexible kind of  architecture altogether right so uh so  in in nutshell it's uh the core skills  that the that a person should have all  these verticals like the distributed uh  system design the networking security  data that we talked about and then we  have the add-on service like we should  be familiar with that what the industry  has has already invented and we should  leverage instead of reinventing the  wheel so if we if we mix the two that  will really help us to make a a full  stack kind of edge edge engineer edge  architect to build the solution  altogether and because right now finding  these kind of skills is not possible uh  from the industry and that's why most of  the organization especially the our  company actually has some organic growth  of our people so we have we are running  some academies academies actually we  have a  consolidated curriculum we are building  those skills all together right so i  think this is where  i would highly recommend that if someone  would like to start their career into  the edge computing uh the the start with  the frameworks like edge like we have a  lot of  linux foundation and the cncf these are  the two areas that people can start with  plus they should revisit to their  courseware the distributed computing  fundamentals networking essentials right  those respects has to be taken care of  together  in fact i'm actually in talks with the  linux foundation to see if we can do  something together absolutely  i'll take the setup  and and i just wanted to add we also  have explored all the uh frameworks  using uh the the lf we have also built  some kind of accelerators the iot at the  mla at the edge so like again the other  panel is mentioned about the deployment  issues so we have a mldx you can deploy  your solution at the edge at the real  time without it's a kind of zero down  time so that you can uh you know  continues learning at the central place  and distributing or delivering the new  updated upgraded model onto the edge  itself so that's kind of capabilities  are essential for nait digital twins or  the edge computing and all this stuff  anything  karthik and rajesh you want to add over  and above what ajay and sanjiva already  tested from a talent perspective  i think i don't want to dwell into on  deeper but i think  a role of an enterprise architect is  going to become very important because  here you have to combine everything  because when you're talking of an edge  basically the resources are going to be  limited so how well you  utilize those resources for the  application or the use case which is  getting built is going to become very  important  so a person having knowledge about the  various tools and i think people have  spoken about ci cd is going to become  important devops is going to become  important so having capabilities on  those kind of tools which would enable  those is going to become important but  in my view enterprise architect to  understand the use case and look at an  architecture in a holistic view is going  to become a very important  skill set to have to make these  successful these use cases successful  so i come to the final section uh  very quickly uh i wanted to hear from  karthik and sanjeev on the emerging  opportunities  uh from edge and  how are companies monetizing these  opportunities  so  cutting do you want to go first  [Music]  yeah  see as we have seen a lot of  opportunities in edge  uh coming together as we said earlier  like 5g  iot and  bringing lot of innovations in the  industry perspective  there are a lot of exciting use cases we  see in  as sanjay was telling in autonomous  vehicles  in drones as well as in metals as we  touched earlier but  the metabolism is going to be huge uh  already the digital economy started  growing in metabolism we see a lot of  people started creating  buying selling uh digital assets in a  metals  is one area can we can focus uh we see a  lot of purpose built hardwares for a  tower's perspective  at least for initial use cases what they  claim and  [Music]  out over the time uh  it's it seems to be growing  and one of the thing is they are trying  to offload that compute capabilities  that what the devices require  uh to the near edge so that the device  itself will become lightweight uh  it can be easily adaptable cheap  uh those kind of stuff we are seeing  and from mobility perspective as i  sent you has already told more on like  roadside units to  offload those compute from autonomous  vehicles  those are also getting explored  a lot of researchers are going on with  agriculture and ugly use cases these are  the areas of trends we are seeing in  each community  okay yeah so of course uh the metaverse  is definitely though i was uh i was  waiting for my call when rajesh was  talking about metaverse right i'm very  excited to talk about the metaverse yes  uh because uh the  like rajesh mentioned that the edge and  the 5g are the backbone for me towers  right because augmented reality uh  required lot of data to process at the  edge itself and and uh especially let's  say if you view a headset for example  like oculus for example right that do  some processing and but it is connecting  to your facebook account or your central  server right now think about that if  there is a latency and if i'm talking to  someone else as a let's say virtual  workplace or maybe let's say agile  stand-up meeting is happening and i'm a  digital world for example right that  latency latency will kill that  experience and metaverse is all about  experience right nothing else so if we  if we have a you know if we uh see that  metaverse and the adoption of 5g and the  edge computing that will make it as a  real happen and right now metaverse  seems to be in fancy or any more more of  a prototype reason being is that because  right now we don't have the sufficient  infrastructure in place so uh especially  the csps the communication service  providers need to upgrade their backbone  they need to have the edge-enabled  infrastructure in place so that we have  a mobile edge computing we so that you  know our devices can be connected to the  closure to us and we can have more rich  experience more real experience all  together right and that that is that  that is the reason that though  technology wise uh the uh right now we  are more of a technological stuff but  not on the use case stuff because you  know i am conducting a workshop better i  can i can personally visit and and meet  my people not in a digital world because  that will be overhead as well for me but  if we have that experience the the zero  downtime  or maybe a  very minimal intensive example right i  can have that experience and the uh the  the situations like pandemic uh i can  actually have that experience i can meet  and one of the example i tell you that  in recent one of the customer actually  are working is that we are  thinking of a green kind of airports for  example right we can have a virtual  meetup so people especially the  corporate travelers they can meet their  families in a virtual zone and those  kind of use cases where monetization can  happen right so monetization i see into  two pieces one is that okay how can we  can optimize the cost so if i send lo a  small set of data to the central server  for processing right i can optimize my  course that is the monetization way of  looking how can optimize infrastructure  optimal you know operation as well  second is that how can i cross sell so  if i have some uh through the gaming  let's say i have a ar vr and through  that here we are i'm setting selling a  air vr or a maybe uh air kind of  applications but in addition to that  because i'm i'm gaining more attention  on the experience side i can have a  closer so the opportunities are endless  and i i believe that the the prediction  is 1.5 trillion billion dollar by 2029  into the meat hours and that's why  recently we have established the coe and  i'm sure that this is in the next two  years we will have a lot of  improvements and upgradation in the  metaverse area and a lot of monetization  capitals  and finally since we are running out of  time i'll be in the last question but it  is equally important it is in terms of  edge computing strategy right any  company that is looking at  deploying uh edge computing what is the  strategy  uh that they need to building what are  the factors that they need to take into  account in building  you know edge computing  strategy rajesh can we go with you on  that booth i i think strategy is a very  big word i would say i think something  what you define should have a clear use  case and what is the outcome that you  are looking for  if you are able to achieve that in my  view your age strategy works it will be  driven more by edge  by the use cases that you're talking  about but yes when you're talking of a  large enterprise deploying this you will  have to bring in some amount of  standardization you can't have for every  use case a new way of doing things so  you will have to create a framework  that you what you would want to deploy  and how you would want to deploy and how  you want to monitor and manage it from  an overall use cases perspective so  create a framework  and then look at use case clearly define  what is the outcome that you want from  that use case and then deploy it  according to that  simple not too many  uh things to be taken into  is that so there are five or six  actually attributes to be considered one  is that do you really need a load  tendency application or not do you  really need the offline and online  connectivity the smart connectivity or  not right do you really need to have the  intelligence  for the critical decision making all  right so there are five or six factors  actually we have that that will be  decision factor uh whether we go so  instead of going with a technological  dream and go with the business case  given that is the right way too  yes as  i just told rightly defining edge is  going to be critical for any  organization  the proper definition of edge should  come  with what kind of workload what latency  they require  what kind of hardware they are going to  use what kind of a network connectivity  they are they have to define each  property  the second thing should be the adoption  of hybrid mindset  that is so one factor that we see like  the organization should have a mindset  to adopt hybrid  and bring a unified control plan or a  management plane for both on-prem uh and  as well as circle  as edges having a different kind of an  elasticity and scalability choosing the  right components is going to be critical  otherwise  uh not only competent services and  integrations is also critical otherwise  the value that edge use case generate uh  they may not be able to see that roi  what they are trying to deploy  uh apart from that like uh when when it  comes to enterprise applications uh if  they try to  uh deploy it on edge or if they if they  try to they may not be suitable or  modular portable enough for each  computing environment  the consideration has to be taken like  whether they have to build those  capabilities into their existing  applications are completely those kind  of a  balanced decision has to be taken prior  just uh  just adopting an h2  cloud kind of a situation  then  the culture itot  teams as we see a lot of organization  the field the service team is little bit  different compared to that idt  especially in manufacturing the ot has  their own functionality and safety  concerns and other stuff  so the both the teams has to work  together uh the people has to come  together to  see like what kind of data has to be  pulled out what benefits they can bring  out  these are certain considerations uh they  should take prior  jumping so it should be a phased manner  from my perspective uh they have to have  some discovery gap analysis to define  edge and then they can build a portfolio  like a single factory portfolio use case  portfolio or a retail store portfolio  then they can scale it too many and many  to all player  just a last note from my side as well so  uh a great uh you know feedback so  you have to define a good framework  that's that's for sure uh you have to go  with the use case uh instead of  technology uh so all the panelists have  added that i just like to add one thing  on to it uh  which is you know you'll need to build  an edge which  makes uh for the best user experience so  this is the third aspect that we're  already working on from last four five  years uh we have uh done something uh  you know on the iot sense uh which is  our full-scale iot platform uh you know  it provides real-time analytics  rule-based actions and interim  communication that is there  we have predict sense uh which is an  aiml based platform we have vision sense  uh so we are trying to build in a good  user experience all together while  enabling uh you know framework and a  good roi uh you know that we are seeking  out  for  so yeah  i think at the end of the day what is  the one  requirement i feel is that there's a  fail-proof connectivity infrastructure  for all these to work out  otherwise i think it might be a bit of a  unpleasant user experience if i may call  it that but  we've run out of time i want to thank  the panelists thank you so much it was a  great great interaction  i've got a lot of points which i can  pick up and explore further so i will  reach out to you again  i will keep this conversation going i  also want to thank the participants for  you know joining in  there are some questions but  unfortunately since we have run out of  time we will not be able to take it  but i'll  connect with the audience later and you  know  share the responses to that question as  well but thank you very much and have a  great day everyone thank you thank you  hey everybody I'm Stephen foskett uh  publisher of Gestalt it and uh organizer  Tech field day and we are here at Tech  Field Day in Santa Clara uh where we  have been discussing uh the evolution of  computing uh we talked about cxl and uh  the emerging uh composable  infrastructure we talked about the cloud  we talked about the data center and the  changing emphasis between cloud and data  center and Edge and that's one of the  things that came up uh again and again  and again here at Tech field day is the  world of edge Computing now we actually  did a round table discussion uh about  this uh previously  um and frankly uh it's questionable  exactly what the edge is is it anything  that's not in the data center is does  the cloud count does a mobile device  count I don't want to necessarily have  that argument but what I do want to talk  about is the fact that more and more  devices are being moved out of the  confines of the data center and into  other locations whether it is retail or  industrial iot or increasingly mobile  ships military all sorts of things uh  heck even the moon as we as we talked  about in Mars I mean you know the  cubesats around Mars I guess that's Edge  Computing too so um the question is uh  first off for the delegates how real is  this or is this just another marketing  Trend are things really being moved to  the edge who wants to start with that  well if I can start very quickly I mean  we always had Hedge  you know and so remote offices so  everything that was outside the data  center  was at maybe we didn't have ads as a  ward years ago  I mean most of my  customers at that time when I was you  know  really building infrastructure so when I  had this real job and and  they had you know remote offices all  over the work connected with the mpls's  or you know other other stuff but yeah  we used to call it Robo right yeah but  essentially what's happening now is  there's just more capabilities that what  we can bring to these remote locations  that you know instead of calling  removable we're calling them Edge but  all of a sudden there's more devices  more capabilities more bandwidth  whatever right and so capabilities have  enhanced and so we there's a lot of  things that used to be centralized that  can be decentralized uh in a good way  that will help out the business that  just weren't previously possible yeah  yeah we always had Edge but it's just  getting better and so we need a better  name for it I guess I don't know what  what happened to the DMZ  you still have it but it can be I mean  it can be kind of anywhere right but uh  that's a different problem I think I I  just like looked up uh Windows domain  controllers and when the read-only  domain controllers is really designed as  like a remote Office Solution it was  introduced in Windows 2008 and now  Microsoft basically says don't use them  but that's a different story uh yeah I  think it's it's just kind of always been  there it's just evolved into what we're  doing and and what we see  I'm expanding I mean so a few years ago  the remote workers were less and now you  know  especially after the pandemic everybody  could be a remote worker so many  Enterprises adopted technology SAS  software in many  in many circumstances that you know and  it was not the case  you know before the pandemic for example  and so now you are this continuous  expansion uh to you know towards the far  Edge and it's changing everything even  in you know security for some companies  I mean some were already there but  actually for others this Paradigm change  also change the the way they have to  think security so do we drive that down  that rabbit hole now uh of what is Edge  like does the distributive Workforce  count as an edge or is it more along the  lines of a location with a you know a  closet where a bunch of gear goes yeah  I've also wanted to jump in and stir the  pot a little bit because I remember  um before the cloud was a thing right it  was like someone read it in CIO magazine  at the time I worked in a very very  large data center it was my company I  worked for was one of the top five  biggest consumers of VMware in the world  right sorry to start in cloud cloud  we're all looking at each other like  we've been we've been doing this stuff  for like a long time right so we had the  cloud Trend and I kind of feel like  the cloud is commonplace now right  there's no more Cloud Trend it's no more  it's everywhere there's no more like  this is the bud word this is the hot new  thing someone says Cloud at this point  your eye is kind of plays over and  Stephen I want to jump back to something  we talked about on other round Table  Right uh the whole 2020 thing kind of  faced um pushed some changes in the  Computing World in general so this is  like the next evolution of stuff right  everybody went into the cloud we're good  with the cloud well what's the next  what's the next big thing we're going to  talk about right is people didn't get  into their data center so maybe they  started doing stuff other places and you  know robo's been around forever I used  to do a bunch of Robo stuff  um too with like manufacturing and  things like that so I kind of feel like  this is like the next hot Trend which  kind of ties into well how do you define  it this goes back to the early days of  the cloud where we're just like well how  how do you define the cloud anywhere  like what is it how do you put a name on  it it's like the same thing over again  because we need that next big thing I  guess is a  technological Society to gravitate  towards  so it sounds like you're skeptical uh  yeah pretty much  okay well let's let's go in that  direction uh  skepticism well I actually I mean if you  look at even the vendors okay so a few  years ago they didn't have hedge real  Edge servers I mean yeah  think about the rotate shop okay to the  you I mean at least I saw a lot of times  PCS used as servers and you know cabling  that didn't really make any sense so  other stuff that you you can't really  think of if you have an Enterprise  solution even if it's a retail shop and  the other day I saw a major vendor  proposing a you know server designed for  for the edge which which is smaller  which is uh you know uh with a different  uh funds to to not you know to to avoid  too much noise uh a form factor that can  stay actually in the advertisement they  showed it in a broom closet  because this is where this stuff is okay  so it's more rugged put it this way and  and so they they are they are finally  understanding that users are are asking  for it I mean asking for this kind of  devices and and they were uh let's say  Niche uh vendors that were building this  stuff now you know even the primary  vendors are are finally understanding  and building stuff that makes sense for  for this kind of applications so it's  not really  a trend or a you know it's not just a  fashion it's something and and users are  asking for it now the management part  could be a totally different story  because on one end you know now finally  we have the hardware software comes  always later you know what we call  usually Fleet Management okay so how do  you manage uh devices that are deployed  in the middle of nowhere are you you  know install patches install everything  and you know the first day uh the easier  install of this stuff because you have  the clerk you you have somebody  that doesn't know anything about  computers in this retail shop and they  have to plug it in you know attach the  network the machine for the first time  so all the management is well there are  solutions but they are not as common as  we may think they're not coming so it's  like the bailing wire and duct tape that  used to hold together our data center  infrastructure forever is now just  moving out to these all these different  locations and we're getting by as best  we can until uh the space matures right  like you said there's Solutions but  they're not really complete or  comprehensive will the space ever mature  in terms of like management and location  you're not going to build a data center  on your remote site and you're always  going to have to put no matter what the  form factor of the computer is you're  always going to have to put it somewhere  uh-huh and and it's going to get Dusty  and  fans will clog up and things like that  what do you think yeah that's where they  they start to look I think uh from a  management perspective a lot more like a  like a corporate laptop is yeah  um where they're much more disposable  than the hardware that you've got in the  data center something goes wrong with it  um you know what we'll we'll just  re-image it completely that doesn't work  we'll just ship you another one and and  Slot it in  um that that it's you're not going to be  dispatching someone with a lot of  technical skill to go and resolve them  yeah well you do a lot of work with like  Wi-Fi and like places where access  points don't get touched by Wi-Fi  Engineers after after they're dropped  off uh mostly how does that kind of  support work because that's a a pretty  good example of edge in a different  context that's a really good point  because I mean basically uh all those  all those APS are Edge Computing yeah  but at their core they're designed from  the start to be centrally managed  um so they're they're for the most part  phoning home to a controller or a Cloud  solution and you're monitoring them that  way um if they've got mechanisms within  the software that hey this radio is  stuck we're going to bring that down and  come back up and that's just that's just  part of it at its core  um I mean there's  also the mechanism within design that  we're doing some level of overlapping  coverage where if you lose one maybe  it's not ideal there's still secondary  coverage for you to connect to and it'll  still work in that area  um so there's a there's a lot that that  solution has going for it but it was  designed from the start to be  distributed yeah it's interesting sorry  Henrico no problem one of the things  that I love about the tech Field Day  events is we can get people from  different disciplines together and we  can learn from each other and I remember  when sd-wan was coming and the wi-fi  people were like hey you know we've  already been talking about you know  separating management management plane  or control plane from data plane we've  already been talking about Remote device  management and all this stuff for years  and years and here you are as well  saying the same thing again because out  of necessity you've had to do exactly  what you just said you've had to figure  out out of box experience you've had to  figure out uh how to have  um  non-uh you know inexperienced installers  difficult  locations I mean you know you think that  it's hard to have a rack of servers in a  in a in a warehouse how about uh all the  different places access points have to  go underneath the seats at a stadium  Outdoors or something so I think that we  can learn so much from the world of  Wi-Fi when we're trying to think about  Edge Computing right yeah  um yeah absolutely and I think one of  the things that when we talk about these  servers that are out at the edge  um a very common workflow that I have is  that if there's an AP that isn't really  doing what it needs to do it's a factory  reset it comes up Auto Discovery happens  it phones home and this entire  configuration is pushed back to it that  that auto discovery that ztp  um the further away you're going to get  from the data center and your your core  team of people that are deploying it the  more important that's going to end up  being  don't you think of that you know but to  the point of you know having these  management planes and separated by the  data planes and everything so the the  the future of the energy is hyper  convergence anyway so from that from the  perspective of management Simplicity  having you know uh uh everything that  looks  similar somehow in the way you manage it  so this is probably you know the most  interesting Evolution for HCI I mean so  the Fleet Management part everything and  oh and very at the moment very few  vendors are taking you know the  necessary step to build the the  the software to manage at scale this  kind of environments yeah and and for  that I actually want to call out one  company in particular that's talking  about this which is scale Computing yes  they are 100 working on basically HCI  for Edge and it is it is it's a natural  fit I think that they didn't even maybe  know that it was a Fit until people  started buying it and using it that way  because you don't want to be in the  situation that so many Edge Computing or  remote offices or warehouses or whatever  were in previously where you had all  this different equipment all these  cables all the specialized stuff that no  one could touch that was you know buried  under something in the warehouse  right yeah if you can just plug in power  and ethernet you're done uh and it's  also disposable to the point where it's  easy to replace meaning uh to your point  I don't everything's centrally managed I  just Swap and replace if something fails  uh much easier to maintain than the more  complex solution with all these  different moving parts that you know are  managed separately but but you need the  hardware needs to be simple as well  because right not like a data center  where you're going to have you're going  to have this rack of rack of storage  rack of compute  um there if you're going if it's going  to be at a remote office or something  you want that all together in one box  where it is literally just power and one  ethernet that goes in so and I think  that's the point he's making is that  that's the fit for hyper convergence  right you've got you've got a plug for  you for ethernet for the uh you know for  the actual communication maybe you have  another one for out of band you have  power and you maybe have two or three of  these uh in a shelter on a rack and  they're swappable basically they just  cluster together and they handle all  that yeah and consider that most of the  time we are talking about in this agile  location you have to or five vehicle  machines not more than that right and so  these are really really small clusters  which is you know introduces a lot of  other issues including that the the you  know the hypervisors itself  uses too much resources for this so so  you need an optimization level that is  really uh really important so both  hardware and software has to be designed  to in a different way well I think it's  it's all the old challenges are still  present and for a robo institution I  mean you do you want to go deploy a  three-tier complex architecture at every  site for your Edge your new Edge it's  going to be a nightmare otherwise I  think there needs to be Innovation for  solid persistent performant storage  those type of things have to be part of  the solution  I mean I think they mostly are in Modern  Edge devices right like you have most of  the Modern Edge devices all show up with  ssds shoot modern laptops almost all  ship with ssds I think it's pretty hard  to find a spinning disc but it's is that  that may be durable but is it replicate  does it have you know other features  that you expect for modern data center  storage but on the other hand is it  necessary  yeah so if you're if you're just rolling  out a couple at that location that's not  a high demand on it um and and it's just  sort of servicing the need for low  latency at a specific location or in a  specific region and you've got an  application that supports going back to  your centralized data center as a backup  if that's storage fails is that okay and  that's going to be use case and  application driven I think we're talking  about this the other day hopefully the  idea is that maybe there's a lot of data  being created at the edge and maybe it's  being processed to a degree but then  it's you know offloaded somewhere else  and if if you lose capabilities there  then you just start a new you put in the  new hardware you boot it up you  configure it and everything's pulled  down and nothing is lost and I think  that would be the hope that's feasible  for most Edge locations these days I  feel like as network connectivity is  proliferated through all kinds of new  stuff whether it's sd-wan or 5G or  whatever uh and the need to basically  have some kind of resilient data store  at The Edge is not as important as it  was in the past and we were pretty much  a three tier everywhere right yeah I  mean what if your use cases you want an  a domain controller that's not an Azure  domain controller on your Edge device  yeah have you have you ever thought  about the edge as you know also the the  next room to you for some technologies I  mean think about decentralized storage  peer-to-peer storage that failed so many  times because because you know the why  it is designed but actually if you have  1000 shops and you have you know the  connectivity that is now available  practically everywhere why not build a  huge Object Store out of this 1000 nodes  yeah I mean they are all under your  control so you you have a certain level  of security you have resources there to  run two for virtual machines and maybe  you have a couple of hard drives or  better ssds doing nothing for you know  99 of the time so you can you know save  huge amounts of money and this is you  know disaster recovery it's all included  yeah for free form factor aside you're  focusing on the functionality like that  I mean it it could be a win so Edge Edge  has a lot it's still it's it's  undiscovered a lot of potential yeah  absolutely and I think that that's  exciting uh whether it's cloud or  whether it's you know sd-wan or Wi-Fi or  whatever topic to see how these  Technologies can be brought to bear I  love that Enrico because you're so right  that so many of these um distributed and  peer-to-peer uh approaches have been  attempted in places that they really  kind of didn't belong but suddenly maybe  it's a natural fit and I think that's  why it's so great to like have all these  different perspectives here because you  know I think that that people from  different Industries are going to be  able to say wait wait wait what about  this you know the out of box experience  the fact that you know you just opened  up a brand new piece of piece of  hardware and you don't know what to do  with it and it and it kind of phones  home and configures itself uh you know  this whole taxonomy of of of management  versus operational control versus  production  um hyper convergence all these things  are  you know make a lot of sense in this in  this environment you know what other  Technologies can you think of I mean one  of the things that just jumps to my mind  is that some of the uh data center  products that have been developed to  control uh temperature and uh and so on  those could be deployed very much at the  edge too I've seen some interesting  sealed racks with their own cooling  systems that you know maybe in a data  center okay I can see why that's  important but in the edge yeah I can see  why that's extremely important  yeah I mean some some of the devices you  see are more tolerant to a range of  temperatures and can in atmospheric  conditions but at the same time if  you're going to have a rack of devices  you're probably going to want that  temperature control to be localized  because that means you don't have to  build a special room and count on  somebody to run it and and all of those  things  any other Technologies you can think of  I mean connectivity Technologies  um I know that there's a lot of  companies that we've seen at Tech field  day I mean I you know zero tier for  example punching through firewalls yeah  I I don't want to say the other word but  Docker containers uh are pretty useful I  think in terms of being able to run like  get higher levels of density uh in a  sense of virtualization uh to run a lot  of workloads so especially workloads  that can support it uh it's that can be  a good approach to to get more out of  the hardware that's that's there well  and and you know after this round table  we are going to set it right so think  about all the I mean there are some very  coordinate use cases but but you have  thousands of CPUs  at this point you have a super computer  do you have any workload that can run  maybe during the night I mean when you  are not using your virtual machines for  for your store for I don't want to mine  Bitcoin yeah you can buy but maybe we  can search for extraterrestrial  intelligence yeah I mean no but but  maybe you have some some AI workload so  you need just to do a major recognition  on thousands and thousand million of I  don't know photos something like that  and you can use these I mean you can  distribute some of these images to the  to these remote locations and then you  during the night you don't have anything  to do right and maybe you can you can  use it to uh I don't know I mean so you  can have a very huge distributed  database of some sort so that's why  you've you've mentioned the idea of  a mass metric Matrix of edge Computing  devices together you have the network  you have the the resources they are  distributed I mean it's the secondary  we're going to see a great example of  that this afternoon  for a long time or like the first thing  at home like it's all it's using  distributed Hardware to run the numbers  and then back that's a common data  pattern why I'm the architecture where  you do some analysis or do some analysis  and alerting locally and then everything  gets ultimately uploaded to some larger  centralized system that does batch  processing I think it's in deeper  analysis yeah yeah and and I'll just  chime in about industrial iot is  definitely trending in that direction  where there's sort of this tiered  approach where you do data collection  um on-site then you have machine  learning that's processing that data on  site in Edge Computing resources and  then you pass up the up the stack the  most interesting or relevant metrics to  the next level and I think that that's  uh absolutely something that we're going  to see in Edge Computing so that means  that this environment is not going to  necessarily be a hyper-converged  standard systems because it's going to  need processing it's going to need ml  processing power and so on it may be a  bigger system than we think that is  existing in these in these Edge sites I  mean you know let's talk you know retail  um you know if if you're going to have a  whole bunch of cameras and sensors and  so on uh you're going to need some  pretty some pretty strong computation  capabilities to deal with all that data  on site in order before you pass it up  the stack or before you pass it to  distributed  um and and so I could see that these  systems may not be as simple as we think  they may be  or am I wrong nothing ever is so uh once  we started playing this stuff more in  the field then we're gonna realize all  the things we've forgotten about most  likely as happens Time After Time the  oversight's kick in they always do well  and again so they are they are powerful  but so if you think about a phone today  as you know uh specialized uh tensor  uh CPUs or whatever they are called so  they have accelerators for so why not in  your small  Edge server and yes you do video  analysis to analyze the customers  behaviors so that you can position  better your your products in your rotate  shop why not I mean so and you just pass  to the to the cloud or to the core just  the relevant information so you can  collect and see if there are you know  patterns that are similar in other  locations I mean we are we can think  about everything and so you you have you  have a again a lot of resources  distributed you can use them locally and  then distribute things uh sorry and then  send to the core or actually you can  have something at the core distribute to  the to the remote location to something  and then return the result I mean  potentially  it's huge  yeah I I think one of the uh sort of  more approachable near-term applications  of this is is that you've got options  for resiliency of existing workloads and  existing applications is that you've got  manufacturing facilities that that  they've got some centralized like job  data  um that can get pushed down to  um to the equipment all right maybe you  can centralize all of that and just have  a local option here is today's job data  that's going to be on site we lose  access to that centralized you're still  going for the day before before it  becomes a problem  um so I think from an application  perspective you can  um there's a lot of options for existing  things that you're doing now that you're  just moving some of that compute and  some of that storage to on-site uh for  near term  maybe in the future the age definition  will be changed because every discipline  has its own definition regarding to the  age for example you said that iot  devices yes there are lots of iot  devices in the world and they are  getting lots of their producing lots of  data in every hour in every second it's  a huge data Big Data  yeah absolutely and and I think that you  know as Enrico mentions you know more  and more processors are going to have  tensor cores in them and that's going to  drive this because I think that's the  interesting thing is that when you  deploy Solutions uh to solve one problem  you often create your next problem and  so if we deploy more and more tensor  cores at the edge then we're more likely  to collect more data which means that we  haven't actually solved the problem  we've just added more data to process  and then we have to process that and I  think that this is really why  um well I guess this is my question my  final question for you in my mind the  proliferation of networking Technologies  like 5G hyper convergence distributed  storage tensor cores and Industrial iot  and all of this means that edge is maybe  a little different than the old use case  of remote office because where once it  was sort of something you had to  grudgingly do because of poor  communication connections or you know  now it's more of an opportunity and less  of a penalty Am I Wrong am I right  I think you're right so I I say all the  time that like basically it moves in  waves of centralization and  decentralization this is the latest wave  of decentralization  um there's a lot of new stuff we're  getting excited about maybe a little  over enthusiastic about and we'll  probably learn some lessons over the  next few years about what is appropriate  to put in the edge and what's not but by  and large we're going to be seeing far  more capabilities uh going to the edge  than we did previously and we'll stay  there and there might be a few things  that we pull back in when we realize  that wasn't really a good fit for the  edge but most of the stuff we stick out  there will be there to stay yeah yeah I  think it's it's just more a broader  societal thing of measuring more things  precisely right so we're capturing more  data from various devices and in various  things to to be more accurate in our  processes of All Sorts whether they be  industrial or even cooking uh I I think  that's something that's uh  leads to this yeah I think that's really  great insight and I think you're  completely right Ken then there is a a  constant shift between these things but  what happens is is once we've once it  gets its hooks in  um it's going to be there and I think  that's that's what I'm seeing is that  this is not going to go away it's only  going it's going to evolve it's going to  be refined but it's only going to get  more and more well it makes sense  there's a proliferation of data center  Technologies why not apply it at the  edge and make that world more robust  more performance more more productive  well I think that this is uh the  conversation that we're going to be  having now starting now so uh  this is uh the New Frontier or a new  frontier for Tech um this is certainly  something that we're going to be talking  about and uh we at Tech field day are  probably going to be doing an edge Field  Day in uh q1 of 2023. so if you've  listened to this and you've said this is  interesting this is new this is real  this is relevant um stay tuned at Tech  field day maybe subscribe to our  newsletter so you get an announcement  when that happens uh maybe submit  yourself as a presenter or a delegate if  this is your topic because we I think  have to have this conversation because  so many of the technologies that we've  been working with are going to the edge  so many of the drivers of new technology  development are coming from the edge  and I think that that's inevitable and I  think uh you know as as all of you are  pointing out the you know we can't get  carried away with the hype but we have  to reflect on the reality of of what  this new use case needs and how  technology can serve that and that's  pretty much what we do uh here at Tech  field day so uh please keep an eye out  for Edge field day and please do  continue this conversation  um if you go to techfieldday.com you'll  see the names of the delegates around  this table uh maybe in the notes for  this video as well and you can continue  the conversation with them and with us  here at Gestalt it  hello everyone and welcome to the iot  for all podcast I'm Ryan Chacon and on  this episode we are going to get into

podcast thanks for being  here this week  Ryan thanks for having us really a  pleasure to be with you and thanks uh  for allowing us to uh talk with your  with your guests absolutely yeah so um  let's kick this off by having to give a  quick introduction about yourself and uh  the company you're with sure so uh I am  the CTO of iotek systems uh it's a  company based out of the UK as you can  probably tell by my accent I am not uh  British I'm trying to do my best but  um our company is actually a global  company focused on iot and Edge software  um my background is one where I I came  from Dell Computing where we were  building iot Edge gateways and I was the  guy tapped to help  um co-found an open source project  that's known as egex Foundry so the  leading open source Edge software  provider today and Ajax Foundry became a  big part of iotek systems and so that's  what attracted me to IO Tech and that's  been my business now for the last five  years  fantastic  um very exciting conversation that I  know you and I have planned here I'm um  and we're going to be talking about a  couple different areas that are really  interesting and kind of been very  popular as of late for a lot of our  audience one is is The Edge Computing  world and the other is industrial iot  for a bit I wanted to kind of set the  stage for that by asking you to kind of  give me a quick overview from your  perspective of the current state of edge  Computing and the current state of  industrial iot if you want to recap kind  of 2022 and what kind of happened then  that's fantastic but um just kind of  high level it for our audience so we can  kind of set the stage that way yeah I  sure can Ryan so I think um a lot of  complexity in those questions I I always  have to begin any conversation I have  with almost any customer or partner or  what have you to find Edge for me  because everybody's Edge is a little bit  different all right so from an iotex  perspective we are largely focused on  Industrial in fact that's where we got  our start is trying to provide what we  called industrial iot solutions to  companies which meant really trying to  focus on connect things in industrial  spaces into the Enterprise  that has changed  um a bit there's still a large Port of  our of our customer base a large part of  the people we talk to that are  industrial based today but we're seeing  more and more needs emerge from this  what people are generally calling Edge  and the reason we usually have to talk a  little bit about what is your Edge  versus my Edge there's different types  right you've got Edge Computing from the  standpoint of a of a Telco where you and  I are carrying around our cell phones  and we're coming close to environments  where that phone can be used as a device  to alert people on you know that might  I'm present and and I could use some  information all the way down to you know  a home Edge we're talking about things  that are happening inside your own home  space  um industrial Edge which is an extension  of iot so all that is is is coming to  play and the reason I say things have  started to change a little bit is we're  getting into environments now which even  from an Iowa Tech perspective we didn't  perceive originally that these are going  to be large Edge players that's right a  couple of examples  um you know you look at something like  um retail environment retail store and  they need iot space but no they don't  necessarily need iot but they are  starting to bring together all sorts of  different sensing environment and  Equipment into things like the point of  sale where you and I do our checkout  right you know we don't think of that as  industrial right that's not a sensor on  some sort of factory line but lo and  behold that is now very valuable  information that those retailers need to  make all sorts of decisions and to help  customers so Edge is expanding in a lot  of different ways so I'm not sure if I  completely answered the question I took  my best shot no that's great fantastic  um yeah it's a very exciting space a lot  is happening there Edge Computing has  become even more popular to to power a  lot of these Solutions help you drive  down drive down costs and improve kind  of performance across the board so as  we're now into to 2023 and we're kind of  kicking things off what is how do you  kind of view things going into this year  and I guess um you know what we were  hoping to do today is talk about kind of  what the forecast looks like when it  comes to Edge Computing and the  industrial space whether that's together  a little bit separate's fine but I  wanted to kind of talk through a number  of different kind of points that I know  that are on your mind for us to go  through but if you want to maybe high  level that for us and talk about what  the forecast kind of looks like  yeah yeah I I guess I've become infamous  over some of the predictions I've made  over the last few years some of them I  think are are turning true others or not  are taking time  um so what what I see in in the  marketplace right now first of all a lot  of things as we all have seen in almost  all of our daily and professional lives  have changed over the last few years  with covert right it has impacted a lot  of the ways we see ourselves see our  environments see our businesses  um that is changing things considerably  um where where a few years ago we were  all going to an office and we were  looking to provide iot and educative  billion office not so much anymore but  maybe we need it more now in our  personal space so there are changes in  where we live occupy our time and and  need space so that impacts things and  then there are a lot of other uh  exciting things going on just the way  that the technology is always being  applied to things like environmental  concerns right we are now very much  concerned about saving our planet and  saving resources I'm not going to say  that those weren't important two years  ago but I think it's become more front  and center is our world gets hotter as  our world gets more resource constrained  right Edge in iot Computing can really  help in those spaces so the the impact  of the last few years economically  socially economically I mean  environmentally all those things are are  bringing some changes about in our our  world that are putting iot and Edge  capabilities front and center to to help  solve those problems right right right  what do you what do you think about  um kind of you know the view  then perception people have had about  what Edge Computing is how it works and  what the value can provide to what  companies really need so it sounds like  a lot of companies really want complete  Solutions right  um so how is kind of edge playing into  that or how are things transitioning  from maybe the way Edge was thought  about and being utilized or purchased  into what really people need and want  and how it's kind of working  great question and um we've seen this in  the evolution of our business uh when we  were starting  um  uh faced a lot of early adopters who  were looking at what I call a piece of  parts right help me connect to this  sensor help me get the data to This  Cloud so they were looking they were  early adopters they were figuring out a  lot of it themselves fast forward now a  few years companies are they're done  with that I the way I I read about and  talk about it is we are done playing  games time to get real time to get  serious here I don't want pieces and  parts what I want is a solution we start  to see an evolution of that here in the  last couple of years but now it's  getting real serious where companies are  moving  um or transitioning from pocs and Pilots  right to learn and to experiment and  figure out what's working and now  they're coming to companies are a car to  say pilot PLC I may want to do that just  to prove something out but I need to do  that very quickly it goes in hmm you  know 12 months I'm being asked to  deliver solutions that are going to  either go to our customers or go to our  employees or what have you and these  things have to work so they've gotten  out of the play time and now it is go  time and and that's I think changing the  marketplace considerably it's going to  put some pressure on the marketplace you  know we're going to see some companies  come and go uh bigger companies are  going to make Acquisitions things of  that nature  yeah absolutely  um what about kind of when it comes to  the edge about what I guess as it  relates to security as well so you know  that's becoming a pretty important topic  so like OT Edge security has become you  know something real what what do you  think about that as as we're kind of  looking at this year yeah um so I used  to joke with uh with my going into  customers that would talk about uh  obviously security is a concern you know  it's going to be concern with everybody  anything uh it has to do with the  information flow today  and I would ask companies so tell me  what are your security concerns what  tell me what you're trying to protect  against  and I would joke because it was actually  an answer I got from one of the CEOs I  talked to I don't exactly know what  security is all about in the space all I  do know is I want you to keep me off the  cover of the Wall Street Journal so  security to them was  protect me from making big mistakes but  I don't know what those potential  threats or mistakes are that's also  changing right there's still that  concern don't get me wrong I don't think  any CEO wants to be on the cover of the  Wall Street Journal and certainly we've  seen in the Press  reports of of people coming in and  attacking things at the weakest points  but we have to go a little bit farther  today we actually have to have answers  and importantly I as a CTO and a company  like iotek that's providing Solutions we  have to start to really understand the  real threats right not not just say yeah  we're going to try and help you keep Off  the Wall Street Journal we have to know  where those weakest links are and try to  provide Solutions into that space so  companies are getting more wise leaders  are becoming more wise about what some  of those threats are but now it's  becoming more specific and they need  products that address those specific  needs fantastic absolutely  um so kind of Shifting topics here for a  second if we're taught and but still  talking about kind of this forecast how  have hyperscalers really kind of played  a role in this in in your mind kind of  like what what disruption have they  brought to the market  um and just just kind of overall from  your perspective there to be blunt they  haven't they haven't really played yet  and they haven't really been impactful  yet some of them uh uh you know when we  talk about let's talk about the the  cloud providers uh to be specific you  know  um and we can identify them by name it's  not like everybody doesn't know them  right the Googles the Amazons and  microsofts of the world  they took a very cloud-centric approach  that is we want all the data we want  your data and we want to help you  facilitate to get it all up into our  cloud  and they didn't really understand  OT very well okay and then companies who  bought into that approach started to  look at it and they'd start to look at  their bills and realize this is not  going to work right my my Amazon bill of  transporting all the edge data to the  cloud and then working on it from there  is not going to scale because it's just  an immense Bill and it didn't really add  a lot of value  I think that's got to change and I think  it is changing we're seeing where the  cloud providers in particular is as you  know a cross-section of the hyperscalers  are looking at this saying okay so what  we're going to need to do is we're going  to need to enter this space very much  like uh we'll look at at some of the the  hyperscalers and what their business was  and then how they adapted to something  like mobile technology or uh you know  Cloud SAS I'm sorry SAS or our past time  move of Technologies they entered it  into a big way trying to learn what it  is they can provide is value where it is  they need to hand things off to you but  where they actually provided value  they're starting to learn those lessons  they're learning the lessons that  they're not OT providers right they  don't know operational technology sure  but there's a place they can play  because they do know scale and this is a  big scale problem uh Edge Computing is a  big scale problem so they know scale how  can they apply what they do best into  these environments and bring in the  right expertise to help them where they  they maybe not are specialist and by the  way probably don't belong not all of  your data belongs in the cloud from The  Edge it makes no sense to shovel it up  into the cloud so they're learning okay  great uh what about Ai and ml how do you  think that's like from a forecast  standpoint because obviously that's you  know a big topic and how that needs to  be in there but does everybody really  does everything I guess need need that  uh yeah great great question  um again another kind of a joke and a  side I have with people is you know  Ai and ml is part of the solution I  don't know what the problem is but we're  going to make it part of the solution  that was kind of our approach you know  is AI and ml became big and oh my gosh  it is impactful right it can do so many  things  what we're starting to learn is uh you  don't necessarily need that level of  sophistication that level of uh compute  and and analytics capability to do some  really important critical and return on  investment things at the edge  Simple Rules engines simple little  analytics capability can return some big  Investments so if you're going to say I  need ainl AIML know where and how that's  applied especially when we're talking  about Edge Computing and then think  about that a little bit because it does  put some extra requirements on you you  need some Hefty Duty compute so I I see  an evolution in Ai and ml in that there  are specific use cases or specific  environments where Ai and ml is going to  become very important in Edge Computing  example  visual inference at the edge right all  these all these Edge compute use cases  have cameras all over everything  being able to detect what's going on at  the edge and get an understanding of  that from an image usually takes I Ai  and ml but to determine that something  is a little bit out of alignment you  know your your sensors can do a lot of  that and then you need simple if then  health conditions and hey this value is  not in range let's do something about  that that's not AIML that's what I  learned in my first days of  undergraduate Computing way back when  and that doesn't cost me the type of  funding I need to put together an AIML  model let alone the type of compute  resources I mean right at the edge so  apply it with some uh some understanding  and some constraints and figure out what  it is you really need and how to apply  it just don't say we need AIML at the  edge right right right okay fantastic  last thing I want to ask you and this is  just something I don't know a lot of  people know about but we're talking  about  um kubernetes we haven't actually really  talked about that much at all but it's  it's a pretty popular  um  uh term around a lot of  um you know Tech groups and developer  groups I wanted to talk about kind of  how that plays into to all this  um and you know it's very popular uh  tool for people to be using and but just  from your thoughts how does this kind of  play into what we're talking about here  from a forecast standpoint yeah right so  um once you've developed some sort of  solution for your Edge the next question  is how do we get it out to the edge how  do we deploy org Street manage it  monitor it how do we know it's up and  running  kubernetes has been fantastic in the  Enterprise let's even make it more  General Cloud native Computing cncf  Community has been fantastic at getting  those kinds of problems solved in the  Enterprise deploy orchestrate manage  right but the cloud and the Enterprise  is not the edge  we are resource constrained in many ways  we have needs that are not the same as  the Enterprise for example uh you know  the Enterprise never has to connect that  modbus sensor  the Enterprise doesn't have to have  dedicated you know communication  security channels that say the edge does  so a kubernetes solution is applying an  Enterprise technology and trying to  bring that down the edge can that work  in some cases maybe yep take a look at  it but don't try to apply Enterprise  technology wholesale without really  looking at some of your requirements and  that's the problem that we've seen in  iotek is it's okay to want to bring your  Enterprise technology and thoughts into  the edge to see if they might apply but  don't expect them to solve all needs  there are unique needs in the  orchestration deployment management that  kubernetes or cncf in general don't  handle now that's going to change right  the cncf community just like we talked  about the clouds right how they're  adapting same thing's going to happen  right the cncf community is a huge group  of very Brilliant Minds and they're  trying to figure it out and we see a lot  of of things in that space you know  there's microcates there's k3s there's a  lot of technology in this space  I in my opinion I haven't hit The Sweet  Spot yet but they're they're working  towards it so we're going to see some  things help us in this space  but as a user as somebody who's applying  technology be aware that the Enterprise  tools that you have don't always apply  and you're going to probably have to  look at some Alternatives at the same  time yeah fair enough okay great  um fantastic conversation I really  appreciate you taking the time last  thing I want to ask you before we go is  for audience out there who um I guess  two things I want to ask you one is for  audience out there who wants to learn  more about what you all have going on at  iotek and and just kind of generally  follow up maybe learn more about some of  these these topics what's the best way  they can engage reach out and that kind  of thing like that  yeah I appreciate the opportunity right  so um iotexys.com I always visit the  companies like ours website we provide a  lot of information out there we're part  of lfnge Linux Foundation Edge Computing  and The edgex Foundry so from an open  source uh participation you know we're  very active in those communities and so  we actually find that a lot of people  find us through those sources as well so  we'd love to chat with folks on those  channels as well so  lfedge.orges foundry.org  send me a note love to hear from you  fantastic and last before I let you go  what are you most excited about going  into this year I mean we talked about a  lot of forecast stuff on the edge  industrial side but just generally  speaking something we didn't touch on  anything that people should really keep  their eye out for yeah you know you know  it's um I'm in the UK right now um I'm  based in the US but in the UK right now  boy isn't it nice that we can actually  finally get a chance to meet face to  face talk to clients face to face  there's an element of that that's  wonderful  um but it short Cycles a lot of our our  um work as well I'm hoping to see  acceleration in this market space not  just because we meet in person but  because I think people are excited to  finally get back and into a Groove which  feels a little bit more normal than what  we've experienced over the last two  years absolutely I couldn't agree more I  was just a Cs and um  you know there's I think I said about  115 000 people attended it was people  just loved being back in person uh even  more it's defense you know CS might not  be the best gauge because it's a huge  thing but I'm curious to see how more of  the smaller vertical specific and more  Niche events come back over this year as  opposed to last year so  um so I agree with you it's exciting  Zoom has been our godsend for the last  couple years but I think we could all  use a less um you're still muted and  more of let me shake your hand yeah well  I totally agree with you yeah you get a  lot done I think it's a different kind  of relationship too so you get to a job  absolutely thanks so much for your time  really appreciate it and uh look forward  to getting this out to our audience  Ryan appreciate your time and thanks for  allowing us to speak with you and your  audience absolutely all right everyone  thanks again for watching

episodes as soon as they  become available other than that thanks  again for watching and we'll see you  next time  [Music]  basically  um I wanted to talk to you about  what's going on this year with with Edge  Computing last year we were talking with  One-Stop systems about the AI  transportable concept and where those  systems fit in the overall Edge  Computing landscape  now among the use cases  you were describing last year for data  centers at the edge where aircraft and  Military applications and autonomous  vehicles things like heavy duty  equipment that are in mines how focused  are you going forward on expanding and  do new markets like that or targeting  opportunities like the transportation  industry  yeah so the the AI transportable  strategy that we put in place identified  actually 16 different verticals that we  would approach uh eight in the military  and eight in the commercial industrial  area  and what we're seeing happen is certain  ones are blossoming  and we're getting a lot of activity and  Traction in and for example one of them  is an autonomous trucks on the  commercial industrial side  and that is uh something that where we  appear to be the market leader  um and is a market segment that could  result in revenues to the company of  over a billion dollars so it is  significant it's a very large  fast-growing Market  and is that billion dollar figure like a  five-year  Market plan or or longer  yeah the the actuals on that is based on  third-party data for autonomous trucks  in 2025 that the total opportunity for  products that we build is somewhere  between a half a billion and a billion  dollars and at 2030  it is between uh five and ten billion  dollars  okay so we're talking addressable Market  well so speaking of of money and  earnings you mentioned on an earnings  call recently that the Centauri storage  accelerator  which is a complement to the rigel edge  supercomputer project is is doing well  and that there's a role that that  product has played in four new program  wins in q1 tell us in brief what is a  storage accelerator what is its role in  the autonomous Transportation use case  yeah using the autonomous truck which is  its main uh area it's winning currently  but it's going to be applicable to  others what it basically does is that  for if back up a little bit autonomous  truck when it's driving and they've  driven hundreds of thousands of miles  autonomously with our equipment on board  it is collecting vast amounts of data  terabytes upon terabytes and and it's  doing some processing using our compute  on board so our storage and compute but  it also comes into a hub  and what they want to do is remove that  memory as fast as they can and plug in  another set of memory so historically  what they did is they went into the back  where the sleeping cabinet used to be  where this the the computer and the  storage is they would remove the hard  drives put new hard drives in what we've  done for them to find Rhythm has built  this accelerator that sits on the side  of the truck so somebody can walk up to  the truck open a hatch and slide a hot  swappable canister that has many  terabytes of data and slide in a new one  and the truck can go on and so this  accelerator storage interfaces via PCI  Express cable to the main system and  that way they can get the memory off  which then they dump it into a server in  the hub and it uploads over a course of  weeks or days all that data there is no  network there's no Airway to dump that  data quickly because it's so large so  you have to physically move the memory  so not only when you when a driver gets  to their destination they have to  offload their  their palettes but they're also  offloading their their data now correct  kind of an interesting new right is that  something that you would see the drivers  themselves doing or somebody in in uh  with with the transportation company  itself yeah it's definitely not the  drivers it's uh there there are these  Hub locations that these people reside  um and so they would be coming and  addressing that there is at currently in  these autonomous trucks driving around  there is a person in the truck sitting  in the driver's seat but 99.9 percent of  the time  he is not driving the truck he's only  there as a backup as these trucks are  learning and getting better and better  at their autonomous function so that  person wouldn't be the one coming out  and do it it'd be somebody at the Hub  well speaking of autonomous vehicles uh  you know we say that word and I think a  lot of  people think of things like Teslas and  other futuristic vehicles that are  driving themselves around without driver  intervention  describe for us basically what you are  seeing in the autonomous vehicle Market  you know in in comparison to things that  people are familiar with which is  Tesla's driving around autonomously  without a person in the vehicle you know  what are you seeing in the autonomous  vehicle market and and where are you  playing the role right now yeah so um  one of the interesting facts that most  people are not aware of unless you've  studied this Market is that autonomous  trucks are much further along and be in  reality than autonomous cars  um and one of the Dynamics is that the  autonomous truck has an economic pull  that is enormous because of the 80 000  shorter 80 000 driver shortage that's  going to go to 1 million over time and  the fact that you're buying more on  Amazon than you ever have and you're  going to require even more trucks so the  demand is an economic one and an  autonomous truck  can produce an Roi twice as fast as a  regular truck so the Amazons of the  world the UPS's the fedexes the hunt  Foods they want this so that's what's  driving it to happen sooner  as a result there's money more money  going at it and they're doing it a much  more professional level and in fact the  bad rep is that you know Tesla for  example have had accidents it is not an  autonomous car it's not ready for prime  time it's a nice feature whereas  autonomous truck guys they've had no  accidents there was a report just out  uh three or four days ago from the  safety board uh citing zero accidents  caused by a semi truck over this period  of time  so again I want to repeat that this is a  market happening before autonomous cars  um and uh and as a result there's many  trucks on the road already  I can imagine that  things like the pandemic which changed  our work habits a lot are also going to  change our interest in autonomous  driving Teslas right if I don't really  need to spend three hours driving to  work into the San Francisco Bay Area  anymore  uh you know the demand for that kind of  technology is going to be slower as  you're noting than that for trucks now  what else are you seeing in terms of the  transportation Market I think you were  remarking that a lot of the the training  so to speak of of these vehicles is you  know been taking place on open highways  uh is that starting to  work its way into the city systems or is  it still largely uh autonomous on on the  open Highway  yeah great question one of the reasons  this Market is being able to develop is  that the economics are so strong that  it's willing not to have the perfect  solution  and if you think of what a truck does  and the real value is being able to get  a truck to go across coast to coast in  two days rather than four days and  because 99  99.99 of the time would be on a highway  if they can solve the problem just on  the highway that's a big benefit so  that's exactly what they're doing they  call it Hub to HUB and so the truck in  an autonomous fashion will only drive  the highway miles which is about  one-third the complexity of doing a city  miles so you can imagine a truck driving  along and if it needs refueling it would  pull into a hub which is right off the  freeway  it would refuel once it got to its  destination  um it would empty its its cargo or  trailer and a regular truck would take  it to the Walmart or the Final  Destination through the city and it  would load on another one to  autonomously go back on the highway  so that that is the dynamic that's  happening there  and I guess the other thing that people  are often conflating is again because  Teslas are all electric that maybe this  autonomous vehicle future will also be  all electric but I don't think that's  what you're actually seeing in the  transportation Market currently right I  mean are we seeing uh installation of of  edge Computing into existing Vehicles  right internal combustion engine  vehicles  correct  um so you know in fact in my slide deck  I show this picture of this future look  future looking uh truck and what I point  out to people that's not what's  happening we're not waiting for that so  we're taking regular trucks built by  Peterbilt they're diesel trucks and  adding basically an option to them that  will give it this autonomous  capabilities everything else is normal  in the truck it gets the autonomous  capabilities by adding lidar radar  cameras around the perimeter and other  sensors those feed into our our compute  and storage systems and work with the  software of the system to control the  vehicle so um  that is what's happening so the electric  portion versus the Diesels totally  independent so that doesn't mean it  can't be an electric truck it just means  they're not tied to each other and the  first atomic the first autonomous truck  will probably be primarily diesel  so another aspect of what you're working  on is that you're serving markets where  there are obviously harsh conditions  there's vibration there's extreme  temperatures cold and hot and that's  Central to your company's product  development efforts while customers on  the one hand are wanting more compute  and storage power to deal with data for  applications such as autonomous vehicles  you have to balance that against power  consumption and cooling how are you  addressing some of these challenges or  any areas of research you can mention in  terms of Technology such as liquid  cooling  yeah you know first of all what is so  exciting for us in a lot of these market  segments we're talking about including  autonomous trucks their position is give  me as much performance as you can  and my environment's harsh  and that's our sweet spot that's what we  do we take the latest and greatest  technology from the data center  and we bring it into these harsh  environments and it survives and we're  really kind of stand alone on that  um but what it does also mean is if  we're going to be valuable to the  customer we have to solve some of the  other problems which are the ones you've  listed which includes you know getting  enough power to it and the cooling For  example none of these trucks none of  these cars none of these autonomous  Vehicles were designed to have a 3000  watt computer sitting in them and so  there's work that goes along with these  autonomous truck companies uh to help  with that and do conversion of the power  you know maybe it's 24 volt or 48 volt  into something the computer can work  with and then the second is cooling  which you mentioned and so we're making  investments in cooling that's optimized  for an autonomous truck and working with  people to do that  liquid cooling that is  which is always an interesting challenge  obviously data center providers are  looking at ways to use things like  immersion cooling or  some other methods of using liquids to  take heat away from chips  um you know I guess when you get into a  vehicle  having liquid sloshing around is it's  part of the package but when you're  doing it around Electronics it's it's a  bit of a challenge you know is that  something that you feel like your team  is going to handle in-house or do you  have some suppliers that are working  with you on on some of those challenges  yeah so we have suppliers and partners  working with us on two different aspects  of liquid cooling one is the um the type  of uh plate cooling where there's  actually a plate that sits on like the  CPU and the gpus and liquids flowing  through the system and then we have  somebody else that's working with us on  full immersion and uh we're working with  one of the leaders there we have a close  relationship with them and we're we're  creating some very disruptive Innovative  products for the truck space and others  where the system would be fully immersed  and what helps here is that we can do  this in a very compact form factor  um we were able to get rid of the Heat  and also the liquid we're working with  it to actually help the ruggedization of  the system so  um we're doing a lot of work there we  haven't shared a lot of information on  it but it's a big focus and we believe  it's a door opener in a lot of these AI  transportable markets  I guess I have to have to be a little  bit amused that we're a long time ago  when I had my own pickup truck I had to  change the radiator and the radiator  fluid right and now we're maybe talking  about uh every hundred thousand miles do  I need to change the fluid on my  computer  exactly exactly it's a different world  well so you mentioned also uh I don't  know if it was you or one of the other  Executives who mentioned on the recent  earnings call that uh you might be  looking at not only Partnerships but  perhaps uh some acquisitions  I know as a public company you can't say  this is my particular Target but what  are some areas of interest in terms of  Technologies where you could see down  the road uh maybe an acquisition might  make sense  yeah so we're focused primarily in that  first of all the the opportunity on an  organic level with the stuff we're  working on is so great that it would be  a mistake if we got too distracted by m  a but as a result of things like the  autonomous truck space which is so large  what we're looking for is Acquisitions  down the road that potentially would  make us stronger  more value to the customer and basically  hard to replace and so that tends to  drift into the area potentially cooling  power supplies  additional software layers we have a  software team and we're adding software  layers but doing more on that area it  could drift into safety functions you  know if you think of a truck there's  gonna be a lot of safety built into that  thing before it hits the road with  nobody in it so being able to add more  value on that front so that's what we  think will drive our m a strategy  um as opposed to what we're not really  focused on is rolling up other  HPC companies  um we think we do something really well  and we can add value by you know  branching out and adding technology to  it rather than just have more of the  same okay makes sense yeah I didn't know  if you had any other final thoughts you  would like to maybe add in uh something  that I perhaps missed in in our  conversation so far  yeah I would say that  um you know we're interested in space we  already are designed in working with  three of the top players  and I'm not aware of any other company  that's got three of these guys we have  other people that we know of that have  one uh we knew somebody had two but we  bumped one of them out  um and we look like we have a leadership  position in this area so it's exciting  um  and uh you know we see not only the  production where they're doing training  I mean the development but also being a  player long term in the production  that's our intent and that's what we're  working with and you know focused on as  a company  and so if we were going to come back and  talk to you and say another year and  then another five years what percentage  of your overall business do you think  this would be or is that getting again  too much into the stock knowledge I'll  tell you what I tell investors and that  is that these three uh autonomous truck  companies will be in our top ten this  year  next year and there's probably an  inflection point  um where  uh they could end up being one two and  three  um if not in 23 that could easily happen  in 24 because the the opportunity is so  large and then if we layer off layer on  additional  um players in this market that would  only enhance that so this is this is big  business  um and the other thing I tell investors  is that we're growing somewhere between  15 and 25 a year  uh this growth that could come from this  Market would be an inflection point that  would be much greater than that it's  just a matter when the volumes go from  being 25 systems at a time to hundreds  of systems to thousands of systems  one of the other things I would just add  is something that's pretty interesting  is that since these trucks have been on  the road  or hundreds of thousands of miles  there's a good chance if you live in the  Southwest United States you have passed  one and you never knew it and that's  kind of a scary thought to a lot of  people and they are driving autonomously  but they do have that person for now in  there but eventually that person goes  away  so so who's going to honk the horn when  my kid waves from the window now right  is it going to be the computer vision  system  absolutely  well you know actually since you  mentioned uh growth I just thought what  percentage of your business is  international and is that an opportunity  as well going forward or is there sounds  like there's plenty going on in the  North American Market  yeah so our main business is North  America and Europe  um a much smaller degree in Asia and  right now we're primarily focused on  those two areas but there's  opportunities for this Market segment  and others in Asia so the autonomous  truck is the biggest opportunity right  now is in North America but we're also  pursuing it in Europe and uh some of our  customers are pursuing that in Europe  also as far as AI transportables in  general same same situation we're very  involved on the military front with the  U.S but we're also starting to get  engaged with NATO  um and uh look forward to that because  they're looking for some of the same  things the U.S armed forces are looking  for  I would another comment I'd make is that  I started this off by saying there were  these 16 verticals you know in the  military it's things like a submarine's  one a planes one  uh tank is one in the case of the Indus  the industrial commercial segment some  of the other ones are autonomous farming  tractors  autonomous mining equipment  autonomous bus buses and all of those  have a potential and there are in early  phases of that also or they're using  less sophisticated technology but are an  opportunity to leverage the same things  we're doing in autonomous trucks  [Music]  so welcome to edge industry review  fireside chat i'm jim davis editor of  edge industry review today's topic is  securing networks in the edge computing  era  maybe you wouldn't be surprised anymore  to hear of a startup raising over 300  million dollars but you might be curious  about why a company would develop a new  chip and software to tackle the  networking market dominated by companies  like cisco the company's name pensando  pinsondo describes its products as  enabling a new edge services model of  enterprise and cloud computing their  technology enables the programming of  stateful services integrated into the  network including security services like  firewalls and encryption  we're talking today with scott stevens  cto at pinsondo about the company and  how a chip is going to enable a more  secure world for edge and cloud  computing  scott welcome  thanks jim  so briefly describe the company and what  it is offering  so i think you did a pretty good job of  the intro talking a little bit about  what pensando does but i guess the  simplest answer to that is  we build  next generation silicon software and  orchestration platforms  um to deliver all of those  infrastructure services required for  compute data center build apps whether  we're talking edge compute or large data  centers or hyperscalers so we we package  that in the form factor of either a dpu  so it plugs into a server and we can  offload all those infrastructure  services to the very server edge or uh  with aruba as a top of rec switch we're  at the other end of the cable now we're  at the data center fabric edge and we  can deliver most of those same services  at the edge of the data center so it's a  it's a very useful set of functions for  anybody who's building out compute nodes  larger nodes small nodes edge nodes  wherever they might be  but for the first time  allows anybody in the industry to get  access to the same sort of technology  that's been reserved only for the  hyperscalers until now so really kind of  democratizing  access  to this  fourth generation of how we build out  data center or cloud fabrics where the  services are now part of the fabric  they're not bolted on  on the outside of the fabric any longer  literally bolted as in  a number of different appliances  before i go on though what is a dpu and  why is it going to be useful  in uh our view of the world edge  computing  so if you look at the evolution so edge  computing is based on compute  and for the longest time compute was  based on a cpu  and as as a lot of the the functionality  required for compute became  more complex the gpu market evolved so  if it was graphics intensive or  um ai intensive the cpu would offload to  a gpu and that same compute platform so  now we kind of had two different  processors one doing general purpose  processing and all the application  hosting and everything you might need  and another that could be optimized for  ai or video or  other other data intensive compute  functions  in the last couple of years  the dpu has evolved as the third piece  of this evolved compute platform and the  dpu is the data processing unit and so  what it is is a highly morphed version  of the old nick  where the old nick would just take  something from ethernet and hand it off  to the pci bus  in the server what the dpu has done is  it's essentially  built its own compute platform in that  form factor so the dpu has its own own  processors and its own functions  to deliver as we talked about in the  beginning all those infrastructure  services those stateful things that you  have to do in a fabric so connectivity  you know the sdn stack vxlan that whole  bit but as you mentioned security or  encryption or load balancing or  naps or all these other storage offloads  all of those things can now occur in the  dpu  with no cost to the cpu or the gpu and  so it's just the further optimization of  the compute platform but this time  encompassing the fabric aspects not just  the compute aspects  so given the founders background in the  network industry and the incorporation  of  your technology into switches and line  cards  it's easy for folks to think of pensando  as a network technology provider what  role do you see the company playing in  security  yeah so the founders definitely have a  long history  in in network technologies right the  the founders here  developed most of the data center  innovations for cisco over the last 25  years  so they very much understand how to  build scalable data center fabric  those fabrics and the services  associated with them they've also built  large storage architectures and other  technologies as well  my personal background is actually  security and so there are many of us  here at pinsando that have a security  background as well  and so  if you think about  that this world of how do we further  scale and accelerate networking and  security and storage and all those other  infrastructure services as we build all  this computing environments  we've kind of gone through several  generations and the folks here helped  build the first three and so if you  think about how data centers have  evolved or compute environments have  evolved the first generation back in the  90s was all layer two fabrics and  because there was so many protocols  those ip ipx deck net and all these  other protocols going on and so layer  two was a common way to build them in  the 2000s in the second generation we  focused on ip as the dominant protocol  so we moved to layer three and the  fabrics became not just switching but  routing right so today we think of  fabrics as layer three not just layer  two or both  in the 2010s  as applications started to decompose the  fabric that supported them had to evolve  with that and so again these teams that  you know the team that i'm here with  figured out how to build architectures  and others in the industry of course  figured out architectures like dx lan  and how do we build overlay  architectures in the data center as what  used to be a single application  decomposed into 100 different nodes and  had to interconnect with itself so the  fabric architecture's evolved but  through all three of those generations  any services that you mentioned in the  beginning those appliances or those  other things that we need for security  or or load balancing encryption were  bolted on they were just plugged in  someplace else and we tried to route  packets through them if we needed to  deliver that service to support the  workload and that's really we're  bringing the fourth generation to market  in you know the dpu form factor or the  tor form factor where we're no longer  bolting on those services those services  become part of the fabric the fabric is  no longer stateless it's stateful  and and so we don't have to build all  that complexity that we've had to build  over the years  we were able to simplify the fabric and  so the people who figured out how to do  this for the last you know 30 years  are the same ones that are figuring out  how to take us to the next step and  security obviously is a big part of  doing that correctly  so there is a general concurrence that  data volume at the network edge is  growing so fast that more data  processing should be done  where that's being generated that edge  may be at a factory with  enterprise-owned ip infrastructure  it may be at a regional data center or  even a public cloud provider  interconnected with a wireless network  provider so we think of services like  aws wavelength for example  how should enterprises start to think of  network and application security in this  era of distributed computing  yeah  it's funny we  we call edge a lot of things these days  don't we but  um where is your edge  well and so our edge when we think about  the edge we're really thinking about the  edge between compute and the fabric in  any one of those distributed compute  environments that you mentioned right so  we could talk about a mech out at a 5g  edge we could talk about a data center  in the factory we could talk about the  hyperscaler back in the cloud  and so  from a networking perspective the edge  is as close to the user as possible from  a compute perspective the edge is right  right next to that server right you know  the dpu or the tor at the edge where the  fabric interconnects to the workload  itself  and so our goal our focus obviously is  regardless of which one of those edge  architectures you're pursuing the mac  the data center and the factory or the  hyperscaler  we want to make sure that you have a  consistent way on how you build it i  don't believe that an edge compute  should be different than a data center  compute it should be different from a  cloud compute  the the more we can make them common the  more we can simplify them the better we  are but we know regardless of  which of those compute environments  you're using  the the the traffic in that compute node  in that data center footprint uh is  going to be about 80 east-west and only  20 north south and so the requests  coming in and the answer is going back  out versus all the communication that's  going to happen between those workloads  within the data center about 80 of it is  going to occur in the fabric  and that's been one of the bigger  challenges in how we build these  distributed compute or centralized  compute or hyperscaler architectures  is how do we make sure that all of the  infrastructure services required within  the fabric not just getting in and out  of the fabric  are available they're consistent and  they're simple so how do we do it  without cannibalizing cpu resources on  x86 or putting appliances all over the  place  and how do i give you a common  architecture  so that  scaling and moving more edge compute  nodes further out is just copy paste  because it's exactly the same  architecture that you're using more  centralized  so i'm going to diverge a little into  the east-west traffic notion  i think most of the time when we're  thinking of security we're worried about  being attacked from an outside service  uh however of course a lot of  architecture these days involves  api calls they're not just to our own  resources but it's going to be to a  partner so within a data center  uh there might be an api call to  you know a sas provider for instance  that would be east-west traffic within  the data center right  so  is that what you're talking about when  you're talking about protecting  east-west traffic  there's several ways to look at that  you're absolutely right um but when you  when you think about  let's let's let's focus first on those  decomposed applications  and so or you can do you know web tier  app tier database tier right there's all  these different ways that we build out  these compute environments  but  when when a request comes in and we're  worried about an attack this whole  concept of zero trust sort of emerges as  this conversation what do we do  within that data center fabric  to ensure  that all the communication that's  occurring is what we want to occur and  nothing malicious is happening and so if  you think about it in the context of  zero trust  the  the first job and sort of that zero  trust tenant is instead of building a  perimeter remote around your environment  and assuming anything on this side of  the moat is safe  zero trust says no  we don't trust any communication from  the outside in nor do we trust any  communication within  that fabric and we need to inspect and  ensure that only the communication that  we want to take place happens so that's  really the first focus around east west  is how do we provide security between  those workloads within the fabric so  that how they interact with each other  is only what we want to be happening and  if an attack had occurred and somebody  had gained access into the data center  they're going to start doing malicious  things east west  if we're not able to secure east west if  we're not able to inspect east west  they've got a free-for-all they've got  all the time they want and so again back  to the tenant of zero trust the first  thing we have to do with zero trust is  east-west security you build out from  the the place where your data resides is  where you begin and then you sort of  build out from that towards where the  user sits and think about how do we  control all those interactions  so  the company has made inroads with  centralized  public cloud services  you're integrated into switches  and other technologies  where else will we see pensando another  way of asking might be you know which  edge locations  you know an edge server gateway  inside the factory or some other  enterprise data center  what are some viable markets for the  technology  i think the nice thing about our  technology is it's sort of foundational  and so if we're talking  about a hyperscaler architecture where  we become the dpu  that's sitting in the server edge within  the hyperscalers environment but that  same architecture  is completely relevant for an enterprise  customer that's building on a large data  center and so we can be the dpu for them  um or if they're not ready for a  dpu-based architecture we can be the  stateful tour for them the other end of  that cable right from the server to the  top of rack  and so  those those kind of work everywhere if  you really think about it so whether i'm  a hyperscaler i'm a data center i'm on a  factory floor or i'm in a macro far  distributed edge  those foundational elements are required  to make these things work right i need  to have you know connectivity i need to  have networking i need to have the  ability to secure we make those things  happen regardless of that footprint so i  think the two form factors we have today  are very interesting right as you know  the server edge and the network edge  and i think that's going to be where  you're going to see us for a good amount  of time  and it's really up to the customer in  terms of which form factor makes sense  for them in in the problems they're  trying to solve and the journey there on  to reduce complexity and simplify and  frankly you know if you really want to  we can talk about zero trust on a lot of  things but  in the end people need to figure out how  to better automate what they do within  their data center infrastructure  automation gets rid of of clicking and  manual work automation requires machine  learning machine learning requires  telemetry  we get to see all of the traffic within  the data center architecture we can feed  ml engines from security ml engines to  net performance management ml engines to  to ddos mitigation ml engines and so  being able to provide telemetry in  either of those form factors  to help deal with this need for better  automation  you've got to feed ml ml creates  feedback loop and if they figure out  something they change our posture they  update us through our open apis  to change our security posture or  whatever based on what that ml engine  just found  so it's it's really an interesting space  but i think the form factors are  pretty consistent regardless of where  you need that to be  i'm not sure where  where this question might lead us but  what are the implications of placing  encryption and policy management  capabilities and other  programmed security services outside the  traditional cloud and enterprise data  center environments  most of what we're talking about so far  i think uh you know we would still be  placing security in these places we're  used to putting them  um if i'm thinking of a company like an  akamai or a cloudflare that's using  servers  you know hypothetically with pensando  technology  what might be some of the interesting  possibilities  of placing  dpu-powered  security services in a more distributed  fashion  i think  so you said two interesting things there  so let me stay with you later one um  first which is what's sort of the value  in these distributed computes and these  you know more cdns or or scaling of just  of connectivity to users  um i think the ability to decouple  things like  security or encrypt the crypts  and take them off of x86  means now our servers scale far better  so i get greater efficiency out of my  server because for a lot of those  companies they're using appliances  in front of those servers or they're  using  software running on x86 on that server  and so if i can offload that to the  compute engine of the dpu  i now have  all of that focused on a compute engine  that's optimized for solving that  problem which is associated with those  services and i o and encrypted crypto  security whatever it is we're talking  about  and my x86 environment and x86 isn't  doing moore's law anymore it's not  scaling you know as fast as it used to  and so my x86 environment now gets to  scale far more effectively for the  service i'm delivering so that would be  one of the answers i would give you  there  the other  in the first part of your question if i  understood you correctly  i think when i think about the services  we've been talking about and things like  zero trust versus things like encryption  um zero trust is about inspection of  flows encryption is about obfuscation of  traffic right hiding what it is as it  transits a network and so i think  they're both very relevant they're  different conversations and and we  obviously have the ability to support in  both of those those use cases so they'd  be able to the ability to encrypt and  decrypt at line rate without impacting  the performance of whatever it is i'm  doing  is really powerful  especially in those distributed  environments that you're talking about  but even after i decrypt i still want to  inspect i still want to make sure i know  just because it's encrypted doesn't mean  it's trusted  the other end of the encrypted flow  might be infected and so i still need to  inspect and make sure that  the traffic that i'm getting is what i  am supposed to get and it's coming the  way it's supposed to come to me  and you were talking about scaling  operations  the  speed at which you're doing things like  encrypting and decrypting  isn't  impacting the power budget  as much as one might think right  tell me a little bit about the power  consumption of the chips that we're  adding in here  yeah you know depending on the  generation of silicon we're talking  about here it's you know 20 to  kind of 45 watts of power consumption  per server if we're in the server  footprint and similarly of course if  we're within the tour so it's really low  power draw  um for the kinds of things that we're  talking about and so be being able to  well if you if you do the math  so we add you know a normal nic will run  obviously fewer watts but let's say  we're running 45 watts in a server but  we're replacing a bunch of appliances  that we're probably running a couple  hundred watts each  in what we're able to do  and so the overall efficiency of that  compute environment wherever it is goes  way up because we're not consuming as  much power we're not generating as much  heat we don't need as much cooling  and so there's a lot of advantages that  you get but you get a operationally we  get a simpler environment  fewer operating systems to worry about  fewer things to manage fewer you know  fewer people i need in my op staff to  try to manage the spaghetti of  everything that i've got there um we  start to bring that same paradigm that  the hyperscalers have they don't have  that complexity they don't have those  appliances they have dpus in the cloud  environment  we bring that out to everybody so you  get that same power efficiency  operational efficiency and simplicity in  your compute environment that the rest  are having  and so you've been mentioning the  hyperscalers a lot  obviously folks like aws have been busy  more and more these days designing chips  of their own whether it's for ai or  other functions  um what then is your target market in  terms of a cloud provider  perhaps one that's providing some sort  of a distributed edge cloud for instance  you know is aws your target customer or  is it somebody else i think all the  hyperscalers are our target and as we  talked about in the beginning our  technology is sort of foundational  regardless i mentioned the hyperscalers  a lot because they figured out this dpu  thing  years ago  right and so they're they're the canary  if you will they're the direction  they're the true north like that is how  everybody will build their compute  environments moving forward and so  they've learned how to do it at massive  size and great simplicity and that's the  only way a cloud works right you have to  have massive scale but it has to be  simple and fully  automated to make it happen  there's no reason that shouldn't be  available to everybody else and so any  hyperscaler is a target for what we  build and i think we've got some of the  best silicon and software in the  industry right in terms of how we can do  that for them but  you know any enterprise customer who's  building out a data center framework  wants that same simplicity a service  provider who's building out you know  mech architectures and distributed  compute and centralized compute same  problem right how do i simplify that how  do i reduce the amount of moving parts  and the operational overhead so that i  don't have to necessarily outsource it  to a cloud i can deliver it myself and i  can make that happen so  again what i really like about the  technology that we've got here is it's  foundational regardless of your size or  scope  but it simplifies what we're trying to  do operationally and  it's sort of the you know we're skating  to where the puck is going to go that  that reduction in complexity and that  reduction of power consumption is going  to be key for everybody who continues to  build compute environments whoever that  may be  and of course uh that's really really  important for security to have that  automation and simplification because  lord knows you know even simple things  like securing a bucket of storage you  know those are things that people are  still kind of struggling with  so uh  but having it fully distributed across  the entire data center fabric  it scales now it hasn't scaled within  the fabric before north south we scale  fine but within the fabric east-west and  between all of those like you said the  distributed compute and distributed  storage you need to have a fully  distributed set of security services in  order to make that work without  impacting those services  alexa scott thanks very much for taking  the time to speak with us today i really  appreciate it  jim was a good time thank you very much  [Music]  hi i'm james mcguire and on today's  e-speaks we're talking about edge  computing we're taking a look at where  edge is here in 2022  along the way we're looking about we're  talking about what it means to build  distributed applications and execute  code at the edge some pretty complicated  stuff to discuss that i'm joined by  lakshmi sharma chief product officer at  fastly lakshmi thank you for being with  us today  thank you so much james looking forward  to our conversation today  you know i think that uh edge computing  is having a very big year in the year  2022. we've had a lot of headlines about  cloud all these years but it feels like  this year is the year the edge is really  taking off  uh as you survey the edge computing  market what are a couple of trends you  see driving us forward this year  yeah um  very excited to be talking about this  subject very close to my heart um so the  trends that have been evolving over like  say 10 plus years um the first trend i  would say digital transformation right  as like whether it was retail and banks  and  uh say hospitality like you know any  industries into that as all of them  start to go from like so this you know  in-person in-store  uh real-time experience right let's use  that word real-time for people getting  into the stores getting into the  buildings like for banks or atms so all  of those were like experiences that i  know thanks to actually retail industry  which started to kind of transform the  first because they had the need to do  that first right so the digital  transformation and the certain specific  industries like e-commerce retail and  then banks they transitioning into this  digital experience right so and then  making that real time because if once  you go from store to something omni  channel the words like omni channel  became really kind of prevalent if you  remember from those days right 10 years  ago omni channel means store experience  and digital experience so the digital  transformation was the first trend and  that i would say led into a lot of other  trends that happen and around the same  time happen cloud right the cloud  migration if you want to build a digital  experience of the mobile devices and  then you know  omni channel experiences or it means  basically all kinds of digital endpoint  devices then cloud started to play a  role oh we can offer that right i can be  the point the central point which will  take away your like you know  infrastructure needs and like uh you  know the needs that you don't need to be  worrying about so that you can do  business so the cloud transformation  cloud migration happened so then the  third trend that happened is when you're  building these clouds and putting focus  on the digital basically you're putting  everything onto internet right and then  each of these kind of industries right  retail e-commerce and then banking and  transportation they all needed their own  experience personalized experience and  then you don't get a personalized  experience by just putting things into  centralized cloud right you need to  bring things to the edge  to the retail edge to the e-commerce  site to the bank edge to the you know  any edge that you call transportation  edge so you need to bring it that means  that you need developers  or the code that can be personalized to  those needs right so the personalized  edge needs developers so then that's the  third trend is like the developers kind  of and the developments and then people  who are operationalizing that that is  devops right so the number one digital  transformation second is the cloud  migration and then third is the one in  order to accelerate and support those  towards the you know the software  becoming a key leader into that  transformation then the fourth one is in  order to operationalize that gigantic  personalized edges at each of those  industries you needed things that can  you know that can roll out services  faster that can operationalize things  faster  but then imagine those dev then the  devops kind of you know trend started  instead of going from it ops legacy i.t  to the dev you know the fast and agile  i.t which is devops right and then all  the security teams are coming and say oh  cso teams will come say oh no you're  going too fast for my policies right and  then like still slow slow slow so they  were becoming kind of blocker into the  devops that they needed right and then  they say okay let's just kind of but  then what happened then the number of  vulnerabilities that were coming from  code grew more than csos had to become a  part of the day-to-day thing they're  like hey this phenomena called devsecops  happen right so then the fourth trend is  like devsecops right so the four things  starting from digital transformation  number two is cloud migration and then  third is like the software enabling  everything edge personalized edge  programmable edge and then the devsoc  ops actually making and putting all of  that into the business and the  operations and trying to match the  previous world does it make sense to you  so what are you doing what have you seen  well i i mean i think it's  it's almost like the edge and and uh and  cloud are sort of working together in  many ways  sometimes i think they're they're slowly  in competition i think there's one  really interesting point you said that i  that i want to zone in on and that is  the idea of the personalized edge  um  what exactly do you mean by the  personalization can you give me an  example of that  yeah  so um personalize like you know when i  say i'm i'm talking from the enterprise  experience right let's say i'm a  retailer right or i'm a bank so if  um if i need to kind of i'm in a bra i'm  a bank which is a global bank right so  my requirements for a branch in say u.s  would be different from you know there  would be certain components which are  common but there are the my user profile  the experience that i need to deliver  digitally to users in the say you us or  even within same different parts of us  midwest user versus like you know west  user or east user so you're talking  about the digital experience that you  deliver to different users would be  different the speed that you need to  deliver the workflow that you need to  have the data governance and the data  kind of you know rules that you have all  of them need to be catered to the first  number one industry that you're in so if  i'm retail e-commerce or i you know a  software technology company versus a  bank or a you know health care your  requirements of delivering how you  deliver their digital experience are  different so that's that's what i meant  by like you know the speed is different  the governance is different the  workflows are different and also if  you're you know global company then you  then you want to be giving like very  specialized experience to the users with  one country versus one language and  different that's what i meant the  industry experience the location  experience and then the governance  experience that makes perfect sense  so let's talk about challenges i mean i  know there are plenty of challenges  involved with edge let's look at the  challenges involved with building  distributed applications of the edge i  mean any advice you would give companies  yeah um and i would like your input too  uh you know this is kind of you have  suffered and you have been talking to a  lot of people  so um so the what we see right so  and having been in a cloud company  before right and having talked to  customers um so the trend that is  happening is um is that um from a  personalization perspective going back  to my personalized edge kind of you know  notion so when you want to deliver  something  uh for you know for a particular  location or a particular region  um if if you as a developer i don't want  to be worried about like where is my  region where is my you know zone what  what kind of vm do i need what kind of  because my for my focus should be on the  logic business logic right right truly  hannah vicker and  i'm going to be on internet right i'm  putting this application for internet  public internet so then if i have to so  there are two things i want to avoid one  is  i don't if i'm on internet i don't want  to be figuring out what is my you know  the  am i going to be attacked by bot what  are the signals that i'm going to get  what kind of expressions do i have those  are distractions yeah exactly right so  as an application developer do i need to  become the full stack security developer  and then second is that do i need to  become the full stack infrastructure  developer by figuring out what region  what compute what storage  that's that's the challenge because then  it's it delays mine right from an  infrastructure perspective if i need to  worry about all of them like you know i  need to understand become an  infrastructure like distinguished  engineer maybe to write that application  so so that delay is like the speed that  is so your challenges are  innovation versus speed  and where do you deploy that speed  because as i talked about the location  and the global kind of where are you  deploying the experience personalized  experience are different from location  for user second is that on the security  side right you're worried all the time  being on internet that how do i keep my  application secure so if the velocity  the security  of requirements for delivering an  application  uh for at the edge for your industry for  your personal industry require a lot  more knowledge  if we don't really make it easy for  developers to kind of you know abstract  those information away and just keep  those tools as part of the application  stack does it make sense it really does  and i i think  the other issue that i think about on  the edge is the concept of  where the numbers are getting crunched  where the data analytics is happening  and that  these applications at the edge create a  certain amount and actually an ocean of  data  and then and how do we handle that data  do we crunch it there at the end of the  end point do we move it back to the  headquarters to crunch it  uh and it seems like as time goes on  more and more of that data is getting  handled at the endpoint instead of  needing to go back to headquarters to  get processed that is fantastic that is  fantastic point  uh like you know when you talk about  these you know say reuse cases like say  in automotive right so you're talking  about autonomous cars you're not going  to kind of continue to process those  billions of devices in a car itself  right or maybe hundreds of thousands of  devices you don't have any time this is  the real-time life you're talking about  right at the edge i agree with you so  how do you  um how do you make that decision you  know and  in real time for the data that you're  collecting at edge what do you process  how much of processing power do you need  and then how much of that you kind of  take away for your let's say historic  information or auditing purpose that's  actually this this is a critical need  for  so that's where the data is and  real-time view into the data i come back  to real time all the time because these  applications as you said like so more  and more data is coming like happening  all the time right so the data  processing is important and also when  when you talk about data there is also  that i know that point about how much uh  can i have access to the data if i am  the one kind of providing the ad then  access and you know and policies for who  can access what amount of data what do  you keep at the edge are you allowed to  keep something else like which goes back  to the governance question too i think  there is a huge um direction i have to  say there is a huge  market first of all of how do we kind of  deal with that but also certain  challenges that we need to be kind of  focused on in what data to kind of keep  what data to send and what data goes  back to the customer itself because we  don't have access to the data and we  should not have access to the personal  data  and and what about the idea of machine  learning and artificial intelligence at  the edge and the algorithms learn more  and more to a certain extent they're  operating independently on those  endpoints sometimes i think we're  creating this world where  there's this extreme network it's it's  out there in many ways it's operating by  itself as as the ai and the ml operate  by itself so it's  i'm not sure what my question is how  this thing is fascinating that we put  more machine learning at the edge and  the machine learning gets more  independent so it's almost running  itself out there in those end points  um  yes does it make any sense at all or am  i  am i making that up  no you are not making it up and i i know  that sometimes folks think that i've  heard from some people ah you know  uh aiml everyone has to just talk about  it but that's a reality like you know  when people talk about like  mirrors or the aiml that's real that  happens in life like you know every day  you can we can really automate things  um at edge so that and again everything  is going back to like helping people  right we have businesses so that you  help people and in order to help people  if you can take away  um those routine tasks right if you can  take away that information that is not  really helping them add value to their  life or add more value to a business  right so then that's where ai and ml can  to be honest really help  fast kind of automate things that you  don't really but then if you have to  keep writing automation yourself versus  and imagining the data point that you  talked about if you keep automating kind  of you know if if an engineering is  automating every day oh i have this  better point of data then let me analyze  automate then automate more instead you  can really use ml right ml  start collecting and putting the  automation self-automating that's what  really ml is about and then you can  start to find trends on the data which  is coming right at the edge in order to  deliver value in real time right so the  edge is helping personalize real-time  experiences so aiml becomes very  important to take away the task  that you don't want to and plus like  edge is not centralized data center you  won't have like infinite compute there  you won't have infinite data there so if  you don't really start to kind of take  away things you know in an automated  manner through ml sooner and dumb cert  is something not dumb maybe send certain  things in the centralized place and  decide that sooner  that what is most important to be sent  back to the end user in you know then  then uh each of those edges will become  the gigantic data center so that's for  ai and ml and with tying that to the you  know the question that you had asked  about data i think that becomes really  important  hmm  how are you thinking about it  well i think it's really the interesting  thing i think is that um  those sensors at the edge  i think are still in terms of being able  to handle data and crunch data  are still relatively primitive by  comparison of this the to the data  crunching you know processes back at the  headquarters but  i think as as the years go on and not  that far in the future  the compute power at the edge is going  to get you know greater and greater and  greater so it's like  it  the edges is really is it's going to be  powering our world  what do you think about like tpus gpus  like where do you think they will sit in  the story  well this is a good question i mean i  think that the way the gpu has i think  so revolutionized enterprise i t and we  looked at the gpu in terms of  uh really driving artificial  intelligence forward  uh i'm not sure what i see you know gpus  on the edge are gps gpus living out  there in the edge now  um no i would not i would not want that  that's like too much i mean it's talking  about too much of compute happening at  the edge  we're not ready for that yeah i don't  think gpus but like i would see that  there are like smaller form factors with  tpus that we have seen like you know uh  and which industry has talked about i  think that could be a potential and  that's where like because they're also  optimized for ml and data models so i  think that can be a place and we have  seen industry kind of using them but not  so much gpus at the edge yeah  do you think there will come a time  though when a gpu is at the edge  um  i think that would be too much of space  power and then that would not fit into  the current designs of the  pops and then mini pops and many data  centers that we have i think that will  that will then make it a centralized  data center but at least looking at the  current form factors of the power and  you know the the power uh that these uh  units are taking so until that is kind  of you know changed but that may really  mean that it is really uh optimized to  do something and tpu seem like that  version of that optimal version of the  gpus to me  let's talk about  fastly itself i mean how is fastly  addressing the cdn and the edge  computing needs of its clients  what's the fastly advantage  yeah fastly as i've been saying uh that  the trends that we talk about right the  trends of digital transformation putting  software programmable edge immersive  edge and immersive real-time experiences  fascists have been leading this you know  transformation or being leader into this  uh programming bill edge real-time  immersion applications through its  lowest latency platform you know so we  have been always like a developer's  first company we have always focused on  how do you reduce latency and when i say  latency latency means couple of things  to me latency is that when you configure  uh configure something like latency is  the time to process that's how i see and  while if i was a network engineer many  years ago i would think of latency as  like how much time does it take for a  packet to go from bit to go from one to  another right but then the newer word  like latency to me is that how much time  do you take to  you know push a configuration down how  much time do you take for an application  to come up how much time do you take for  something to roll out right so  at fastly is programmable edge that's  where this company found was founded on  that and edge platform or compute edge  platform has always been software you  know developers first and then we have  we have kept our value around  reducing the latency the amount of time  it takes the first use case had been  like cdn so the way to think about is  that we we have been building an edge  experience platform  built for developers from day zero our  use cases had been cdn  caching you know being the best purging  algorithm so that you get the best cash  hit ratio for any kind of object static  object dynamic objects so we kept  building and keep making it so that we  and then we added more use cases we are  like  you know the our customers were building  like vaf our customers were building  like you know image optimization so we  think of this as that a company that  kept building like a marketplace of the  services that  we found our customers doing because our  customers started to be developers and  devops and those people and then we  acquired six hikes you know signal  science which is a signal based like  security company we also integrated that  back into the edge right so then the  same same people like you know who had  challenges about you know i talked about  like the csos had these challenges like  how do i stay on speed with my devops  folks so we started to also go out to  and then work with those people like in  the devsecops so  we were seen as a cdn company but the  way kind of but we were actually always  helping  a programmable edge company which was  built in the foundation of delivering  everything fast whether it is config  fast deploy fast roll out fast and  policy  so we you know i think so  uh the whole ex you know the  programmable edge personalized  experience at edge we we have been doing  pretty well and cdn gave us that  stepping stone because that's the that's  where the area where we proved our value  the first and then we continue to add on  to that  so is this is the fastly network does it  is it built on or does it interoperate  with the the major cloud  vendors how does it work in that world  uh we um we think of this like we we  kind of are complementary to cloud i  know because cloud started kind of you  know central journey and then there are  you would see almost all the cloud  providers are going towards the edge but  we started from edge right so so we are  complementing and then the way this the  techniques that we use for example we  use like was on which is web apple you  know web assembly uh  web assembly way of putting the modules  together or services together service  chaining at edge and those are like web  requests we are talking literally  services so we had always been web  service first  at the edge while cloud providers were  coming from iis and pairs and then  containers right so  we it's kind of a very good mix or  complementary so we application service  first at edge while cloud providers  started from the cloud centralized model  first we are literally location-less  service anywhere anytime and then clouds  are like you know okay start from  centralized service build a you know  kubernetes cluster or build a you know  service mesh so we are a very good  complimentary uh we can actually have  any platform running on us so we can be  an integrator into anything i would say  aha okay  well given you given how close you are  to the market i'd love to get a sense of  what you think about the future of edge  computing uh what what are some key  milestones you think you see looking  ahead  and i would like your opinion too  because you talk to a lot of people  i please i'll i'll i'll trade you so  what what is your future of what's the  future of edge is as you see it so um so  the edge is just happening i would i  would pick some numbers like we i picked  up from gartner so  uh gartner number says that enterprises  had like five percent of enterprise  workloads were close to  in 2019 were moving to edge you know do  you say five percent five percent in  2019 small and it will be yeah it will  be 40 in 2024 wow okay it's like massive  right yeah yeah if you look at like that  that transformation of the compute  workload that are there but then as we  talked about like earlier then certain  industry kind of went into that sooner  like e-commerce and you know technology  companies others are still exploring the  potential  and like say financial right and other  companies so it's really kind of what  i'm getting to is that it's really use  case driven edge is opening  opportunities that people couldn't  imagine before  right so it's like going back to the  data point point that you mentioned data  governance at the edge and then like you  know keeping like making decisions which  are like real-time telemetry real-time  visibility  real-time in real time did not happen  with cloud and other technologies they  were like  lag if you needed information you would  get samples not full information right  if you needed visibility you will get  like five seconds or so certain interval  visibility not real time so the true  real time personalized happen at the  edge right and then you and there are  technologies now like wasm i talked  about where you can get full isolation  of one you know one customer from  another one organization to another  right at the edge and then you can  really  do things like update and maintenance  everything like you know in your own  isolated environment which is not  possible with other technologies so the  technologies have evolved right  technologies have evolved and that's why  it is opening up newer use cases so  that's where i see that it is just  started and like even if you look at the  numbers that i just talked about and the  technologies that i talked about like  wasm like you know being able to do web  logic and then web assembly not  necessarily web logic that's another  term but web assembly instead of kind of  doing bottoms up infrastructure location  aware to location less logic so  technologies are there  software is evolved and newer use cases  are just coming  and that will kind of create and your  industries are adopting it as i said  like from retail media media and gaming  that that was a kind of our first one  media gaming to retail to e-commerce to  now uh financial and other companies so  i think it's just it just started  hmm yeah i totally agree that that edge  has a very bright future and i don't  think people even realize the extent to  which edge is going to grow and play a  big role in our life i think it's still  sort of an underdog in terms of its  profile  i think one of the issues involved is  uh artificial intelligence and data  because you you with ai you've got the  algorithm but and that's really powerful  but the reality is that algorithm  doesn't do much without a real an ocean  flowing a notion of data flowing into  that algorithm you need to get a lot of  the data to really make that algorithm  powerful so the question is  how do we get that level of data to  those edge and end points and i think  when we solve those kind of problems  with network flow it's going to become  ever more powerful  that's that's 100 right um  data requires a powerful network right  and data requires like um you know once  we have figured out all the data tagging  and data isolation and then you know the  data level problems that what data  required comes with it but then you need  this infrastructure and the network to  actually deal with that you know how  much and then uh there is there would  always be this kind of you know the uh  the return of investment and like the  point that we that  return of investment on the edge what we  have to keep making those decisions and  what  what is the size of the edge right and  how close and personalized do you want  it to be so if you want more and more  personalized then you it needs to stay  nimble it needs to stay small form  factor wise too so that the you know  going back to the cost and all those  kind of um  agility and the cost and everything that  comes with the size and the location  that needs to stay  uh you know that that need that's very  important and then  um that's why like and coming back to  your aiml point  uh if you like you know if i want to  build model if i want to automate more  right at the edge then we need to start  to think about where do you act also  keep these models right because these  models also take kind of that they're  like configurations the model needs  space the model needs storage and then  what models do you actually train better  to stay at the edge versus versus what  models do you kind of get you know move  to the centralized cloud i think that's  something that we need to continue to  work but i i think that would require  all these edge cloud providers and all  of us to work and build a marketplace i  kind of call it i've seen that in my  previous company that  where people kind of you know we you  test a lot of models across different  companies or different customers i mean  and then you take the most relevant one  most used one and you make them like you  know  you offer them to all the customers as  part of your api right so driving a data  model  uh driving a data model or an ai model  machine learning model for your most  personalized use cases delivering that  as an api  because you know most of the customers  would use it and you know bringing more  and more these edge companies into one  place and saying that let's keep adding  more and more  you know the ai models or the data  models to the edge as an api  and i think that will drive a lot of  success  hmm  watch me i i think you said it it's a  lot of fascinating stuff it's going to  be a super interesting secular following  the years ahead and i i greatly  appreciate you sharing your insight  today thank you thank you so much it was  it went again fast like  you and your session it just feels like  very very important which technology  technology itself moves pretty fast  right that is true yeah yeah  thank you thank you  you  hello and welcome this is eric sofci  moderating for mit horizon thank you all  for joining us today we're lucky to have  with us wei seong shi for a discussion  about the future of edge computing  wei song xi is a professor of computer  science and the associate dean for  research and graduate studies at wayne  state university where he directs the  mobile and internet systems laboratory  and the connected and autonomous driving  laboratory  he's also a a distinguished scientist in  the association for computing machinery  an ieee fellow  and in 2019 he was lead editor for ieee  special issue on edge computing  so thanks for joining us weizong  and let's get started  so to  start us off i wanted to first  see if we can establish exactly what  edge computing is  so how do you define it and why are  organizations interested in it right now  thank you eric yeah thank you very much  for having me it's it's an honor to have  this opportunity to share with the  community about the edge computing and  the future so go through your first  question i know there is a very um  general understanding from from the uh  community is that you know we process  the data at the uh as close as possible  you know uh to the data sources but here  the um i would like to give a sort of a  official you know the the definition  which is originally coming from the  paper i wrote in 2016.  so here  we define edge computing as the enabling  technologies  that allow computation to be performed  at the edge of the network  here edge refers to any computing  resources such as cpu network storage  resources along the path from the data  sources to the cloud data centers so it  is a continuum it's not like a wine  device you know as some people  are expected here the computation  involves two directions so including the  downstream  that uh the computation  on behalf of the cloud services  you know and also the upstream uh from  the you know internet of things the data  and then all the way on behalf of the  iot services so i think it's very  important to know that edge computing is  not just one direction actually it's two  directions  yeah um that was the sort of the  definition i would like to share share  here and the you asking why the  organizations are interested in this  that's actually perfectly matching to  that definition i i shared just now for  example as a cloud provider you know  amazon microsoft and google they will be  very interesting to push their services  to the edge uh as close as possible to  the end users and where the data  generates for example amazon you know  lambda computer number computing and etc  and then at the same time you know as  the upstream you know you have a lot of  data collected at the field you know  either field a smart home or maybe in  the manufacturer  and etc in this case you want to do a  lot of computation as close as possible  you know to provide some extra services  uh you know in this case like a smart  manufacturer they are not really coming  from cloud but they come from we have  data we want to do some local processing  here so that that's why there's a lot of  organizations are using this and from  both directions  okay so so it seems like obviously cloud  and edge are uh very related there's a  lot of overlap  um  in in a best case scenario  uh do you think edge computing would  support cloud computing or would it  replace it essentially again only in a  given application obviously not  replacing the entire cloud  yeah  i think that you know from the beginning  when edge computing was  first proposed uh you know that  around 2015  um then people always ask this question  is this going to be something new going  to be replace the cloud uh i don't think  so you know that azure computing is a  extension of cloud  and it complemented with cloud very well  you know as you can see that the cloud  the the beauty of cloud is they have a  global view  imagine you you have an organization  it's a global organization so the cloud  has a global view of everything what's  going on with the multiple factors for  example picking a manufacturing example  they have the global view that they may  they can make some macro kind of  decisions you know some data  machine learning models and etc however  the edge can help them to say well i  want to do some localized you know  processing i also want to have some  customize the design and this so this  would be a perfect example to running  this on the edge  so  in some cases one of the benefits of  edge computing is you increase the  reliability or availability you know per  se because  if you purely rely on one data center  sometimes if there is a you know  networking issue or maybe there's a you  know server down and then the whole the  whole system you know the service will  be interrupted so with multiple ads you  know deployed in the different  geographically for example then at least  you can have some sort of you know  services still available even when the  whole cloud you know is out so i think  in this case they actually um i would  say edge is an extension of cloud but  that makes it much more you know the  the panel traded to our uh to our life  okay and and is there sort of strictly  speaking  are there examples of edge that don't  rely on the cloud at all  yeah yeah i i think that that that is it  is possible for you for example  um  if you want to say completely don't rely  on that it's possible uh for example in  some of this larger warehouse which i'm  aware of for example i'm not sure if  amazon is doing that because amazon  obviously they have a cloud but in some  of this like  jin dom you know jd is one of the bigger  online in china  they have there's a bigger warehouse and  then within the warehouse they're  putting a edge computing there to  coordinate like a 400 you know  autonomous robots  which is sitting there to coordinate  them in this case they don't really need  to rely on cloud you know they can  perfectly to execute themselves improve  the efficiency for that purposes  right it seems like oh i'm sorry go  ahead  sure yeah yeah i think that's that's the  case and also in in some scenarios like  in the uh disaster you know in a  disaster areas and then you're sending a  lot of vehicles coming in um probably  you even you wonder using a cloud but  there's a it's not available at that  time so in some of these scenarios  it is yeah okay yeah it seems like in  that example of the warehouse robots  using the cloud could almost be a  problem because there'd be more of a  delay in you know uh  sending information and receiving it  whereas the edge seems like that's one  of the main advantages right is that  speed of processing and sort of  less uh or data being sent over a  shorter distance right  right  okay the um  so okay you mentioned amazon  one of the things that we've been  looking at with this topic is  this notion of um companies like amazon  and verizon other sort of partnerships  where companies are creating what we're  calling sort of public edge  infrastructure so you might have edge  servers that are placed  in or near a 5g tower or other places  where sort of  nearby users can access them  do you think that sort of approach is  is  eventually going to become the default  for how most people sort of interact  with edge resources or is that just sort  of one part of a larger picture  yeah i i think that is  probably just uh  one part of the larger picture because  as uh as you know that uh to answer  another question let's first start with  look at the in the future where are the  data uh you know where is this data  generated you know according to the  gardener by 2025 75 of the data  generated on this planet will be outside  the  cloud data center  so this then means the cloud center  some people asking oh are you going to  move in the data from cloud to the edge  that's not the case so cloud will be  still going to be increasing however at  the edge of the of the network you're  going to generate  the path you know the pace to generate  the data is much faster than the growing  on the data center so because of this  reason  that uh you can imagine that this is a  huge market here  right because of 75 of the data needs to  be processed  that's why there's a lot of  um potential players gonna be in the  energy computing field the two you  mentioned you know amazon which  represents the cloud providers obviously  uh they have their incentive you know  they want to continuously grow their  business they want to deploy these  things as much as possible and then for  the you also mentioned the verizon att  this telecom you know globally  that all these telecoms including uh  vodafone uk telephonica you know in uh  in spain and china mobile and et cetera  you know in china so  those those  companies there are they view this as a  great opportunity for them because  this so that they can deploy those edges  servers so that uh serving as a  resources  all right so that is uh from their point  of view and now we already see that you  know at t  uh in china unicom they have been  starting deploying these things however  there i i noticed that there is uh uh  that there are some other  you know potential players recently  jumping for example that  the what we in u.s we called  um  for example dt energy you know like a  smart grid  and  yeah especially in in china state grid  because their view is very simple um  where's the data where's this data  generated basically it's uh those data  is generated  by most of the things and they have to  have a power correct  so once you have a power that means they  already have a computing resources there  you know most of the power controllers  that they can add a little bit of  computing resources that will be a  perfect places for for the people to do  that and you know to put the edge  computing resources here so for example  in china what happened is because china  is very similar to new york you know you  have a lot of these  high-rise apartments and right  for you know one of the divisions you  could have like a 30 000 residents in  this area and then they're building  these computing resources next to the uh  you know the the power entries of of the  i i don't know how to describe that that  you know but you know  what i mean here is you know you have to  have some sort of a switch right  then you put in the computing resources  there and uh can serve there's a whole  you know area so that is another  potential player and actually state grid  in china is invested heavily in this i  haven't seen too too much in in the u.s  side probably is because of the density  here is not as dense as as they used to  see in europe or in china scenario so  that's why i my answer to your question  here is on telecom and the cloud  obviously they want to do that  but there's other potential there's  another potential player here is the  city government you know maybe through  some uh some of the private factors of  private sector  the reason here is in addition to the  central tower we also see a lot of  traffic and eyes  you know one of the work that now  recently we deployed at the wayne state  campus is we put in the edge server on  our five intersect intersections  connected to the traffic signal and then  to support our campus uh you know that  uh  we we call this as a connected vehicle  edge computing uh live test bed because  the students your your phone you  you know you can through anyway  wednesday the campus already have a  wi-fi coverage you know even the home  the middle town area at the in detroit  so you can connect it to this edge of  servers and then you can send your  warning about the project you know for  pedestrians a warning for the traffic  and etc so in this case you can see that  this is not necessarily deployed by  either cloud service or you know telecom  this is actually coming maybe coming  from  uh you know traffic transportation area  right  so those are all these people all these  different industry sectors they see  there's a huge potential here so i view  this is that eventually you're going to  see a variety of agents you know  providers and then that's good for our  customers because when you was driving  uh going you know walking through the  city you have an opportunity to to reach  a different type of what is uh you know  the  resources that's it's  it's interesting because it seems like  the common thread there in what you're  describing if you have sort of uh  traffic infrastructure  um  electric or power infrastructure energy  infrastructure and then also the the the  sort of telecom infrastructure it seems  like maybe more than even cloud which  edge is sort of again kind of uh  compared to cloud a lot cloud the  infrastructure issue is handled by  big providers often who just  buy like a large you know plot of land  and and build a huge facility  in this case it seems like we're up  against this infrastructure issue right  where it's where who has the real estate  who has the sort of right-of-way you  know who can who can place edge  servers edge computers in a place where  people can get to them but do you think  i guess i'm curious that obviously  infrastructure issues  pose their own challenges  are there other challenges to or guess  what are the other main challenges to  sort of increased development of edge  computing  yeah this is a great question because  it's the nature of follow-up with that  since we have a potential a variety of  the infrastructure providers here and  then the key things the main obstacle  even today is about how can i develop a  program can can use it  you know when i develop a programming  for example we are computer scientists  here so i want the writing application  today let's say if i want to write an  application to running on my phone  connected with a one of the edge server  here  i don't have a  immediately easy way to do that right so  i think those are something that right  now i view that probably potentially in  the next  um you know five years is going to be  see a  a big improvement here right now  we have seen that  amazon introduce their their own you  know lambda programming uh interface and  then you know some open source info open  source foundation such as openstack you  know originally was a very success in  the cloud now they're moving to  supporting edge and then a linux  foundation rfh also comes with this  adriano kind of uh programming framework  is trying to define several scenarios  how to connect it and and you know  connect it from the device to the edge  and then to the cloud so i think once we  see  um some of this you know programming  interface is clearly defined and then  once we see those uh infrastructure has  been deployed there this is exactly what  we plan to do in the in this year 2022  because we have infrastructures already  put there now we we want to choose one  of the programming infrastructure you  know programming framework there so that  we can allow the students to write in a  code to this so i think oh sorry about  that that's what's the worst thing you  know  yeah normally you don't have this phone  call at home  sorry about that um yeah once once this  barrier has been uh you know we can pass  and then you will see a blue sum of the  applications going to be deployed here i  think that will really enter the you  know edge computing era okay that makes  sense the um so in terms of the  industries that you think should be most  interested in edge computing right now i  mean it sounds like  maybe five or ten years in the future or  at some point  there won't really be a choice for a lot  of of organizations it's just just like  with the cloud you're sort of using it  without thinking about it but are there  are there industries that you think  where organizations in those industries  should actually be paying close  attention to  edge specifically and maybe even sort of  investing or preparing for it again in a  specific way not just in the sense of  knowing that it'll arrive eventually and  become more common  sure you know  uh you know i come from academia so i  maybe and also  uh that uh have a little bit of bios on  this you know just  a warning at the beginning because my  own research is on connected autonomous  vehicle the reason i started working on  this uh back to three years ago because  i view this is an area you know that  they will have to rely on edge computing  you know moving to the next level  you know the the reason is that  traditionally the vehicle  even the business model if we're  thinking bigger you know in the last  century because i come from detroit you  know ford gm is out here if you think  about in last century vehicle itself is  only like a transportation tour you know  what the business model is you and i go  to a dealership buy a vehicle that's it  period  that's how the way they make money right  but now if you're looking for in the  next century the whole the things here  is changing significantly because now  how do you gonna make a money uh you  know the business model behind the  future vehicles as you can see tesla  recently increased their price for the  autopilot from ten thousand to twelve  thousand one that is a very good  indication here is in the future  you all the oems you're getting a  vehicle all right let's say you get a  vehicle at a price x that's just the  beginning of the story so that  continuously they will give you more and  more software-based options and then  that you know the vehicle is all  connected and then that they will  continuously need to update their  vehicle up to your software and you know  either add the new function you you want  to specifically want to you know add or  maybe they need to update the current  soft the software already uh you know  for some certain functions you already  purchased so in these cases the whole  business model is completely  changed and that's also putting a huge  challenge for the infrastructure  you know auto industry  before they don't really care about the  infrastructure you know there was the  only one is the dealership i guess and  now there's very different all the oems  have really think about how can i  maintain this connect connect  connections services with all of the  vehicles that i own for example toyota  alone you know they might have like  definitely close to several uh i don't  know exactly the number but they  probably have like a 50 million vehicles  right actively running on the road right  now so they they need to maintain this  type of  you know connectivities and etc so for  them edge is a very important you know  infrastructure i'm so glad that actually  toyota took the leader created this  so-called aecc uh stands  for uh  automotive edge computing consortium so  right now is a big uh you know  consortium is pushing that the how edge  computing gonna help with the automotive  industry to moving forward you know all  this is a major hardware telecom  companies are part of that uh consortium  so this is one of them i see that  they definitely need to pay attention to  that  what do you think is the main advantage  uh  or the main benefit that edge can  provide uh specifically to automobiles  right so  the advantages does actually apply to  almost the uh all the benefits that the  azure could have potentially brought the  reason is one  uh let's pick an example if you if oem  want to maintain you know  keeping connect collecting data from  this uh  10 million vehicles and then the one  thing is who gonna pay for this data  collection  it's a cost cost for them is very big if  you imagine that  you know you and i have a vehicle and we  need to pay 50 bucks a month just for  them to collecting data no we were not  going to do that right so they have to  pay it but this for them is extra cost  so the first thing is what the edge can  do is as you can significantly reduce  those traffic you know the  the bandwidth requirement because you  can you can do some process on board on  a vehicle and that's sending any very  limited kind of data you know to to the  uh you know sending back to them and  then they probably can cut these costs  too dramatically that's that's the first  one now second is about the scalability  issue because  if you  imagine that each vehicle every five  seconds you collect all the engine  entire and and many other you know  sensor data that itself  is a huge amount of this in terms of  connections so  none of them is able to do that so they  have to rely purely rely on today for  example  with some cloud providers to help them  to store the data you know to stop  collecting the data and storing the  storage and et cetera so those are the  things that they also are going to be  have a huge you know benefit the other  thing is about  so far we are talking about is what i  mentioned earlier today is upstream you  know you're collecting data  so i want to use this as another example  uh it's for the downstream why because  also you know  as i mentioned those softwares because  now we call the software definer  vehicles all the software needed to be  updated so that means you have one  software now you need to update in 10  million vehicles so what are you going  to do so this energy is a very good  example as you can help to  distribute it and that's the  original idea of the content the  delivery network right so it's  you deliver the software in uh  in vehicle side they're called over the  air you know ota or the over-the-air  kind of software update so all these  issues will be they could potentially  benefit from the energy computing  okay that's that's interesting  one thing that you mentioned there was  this idea of  using edge to sort of  lower the amount of bandwidth needed for  you know lots of transfers  and it seems like in part the idea for  edge is that you'll have certain  applications like the ones you mentioned  with cars but other ones maybe for  security or other things where you  handle a lot of the data locally with  edge processors  and then you only send you know a  smaller amount uh out to the cloud or  elsewhere but that it seems like one of  the advantages there is could be  increased privacy right because you  could have an organization that sort of  has better control over the data of  their users and what they're um sending  out what they just destroy after using  it all that stuff just more control  which seems like an increased privacy  i'm curious about  and this is kind of a future sort of  notional issue still but it seems like  it's come up with experts  that there is this potential risk for  security where  if you have these public edge  infrastructure  resources you have them in street lights  or  5g towers or other places places that  unlike a cloud  data center you could maybe get to more  easily you know there's no it's not the  same level of security and all that  stuff that you'd have at like an amazon  uh cloud data center  do you think that it's true that we have  to that this is a genuine sort of  concern going forward that it's it  having sort of  edge infrastructure that's out in the  world and more reliance on edge  could lead to more sort of security  risks like more attacks where a hacker  or whoever could literally just break  into a sort of public box and have  physical access to edge infrastructure  is that a real concern or experts kind  of just reaching  well i'm not a security expert but then  we are trying to understand this um as  we know that the edge uh first i agree  with that you know that uh  there's a potential  that uh  uh particularly the physical  security threat right because now you  hang on your traffic at night you know  people even you they can physically  attack it but we also need to notice  that you know attack on you know one of  the edge devices compared with attacking  a cloud sensor the impact is  completely different imagine you can  even you can destroy the one of the  traffic lights so what's the impact it's  only in this small region right so you  need you know the cost to do this attack  and the impact of this attack is also  dramatically you know reduced  so say if you want you and i want a  physical attack how many how many edge  servers we can attack per day you know  you physically destroy them you are not  going to generate a huge impact here so  i'm not really too worried about that  giving that hey you put in this with  this uh you know traffic at night  so so why we happen to see so many  people attack a trafficking night so  this  other similar things there so i'm not  really worried about that that's too  much in terms of  physical security yeah god okay that's a  great point um so i think the last thing  i wanted to ask you about is about the  the the  future of edge when we look maybe five  years 10 years out are there  sort of major developments or major sort  of changes that you see on the horizon  or is it just a matter of well it'll  become more accessible because there'll  be sort of more infrastructure available  is there anything more dramatic or  anything like a trend or again a  development you think is worth keeping  an eye on  oh yes i i think that uh  you know edge computing since we've seen  is already been here a particular  academic  academia that they already been talking  about this for about five years so i  think now the really a good trend is uh  keep an eye on your own industry you  know sector because as i as i mentioned  earlier auto industry right now seems  like already realized this is very  important so i'm sure that maybe five  years later they will have some really  good progress and then in some sectors  they just realized that for example in  the health domain again they're because  of the privacy issues also the data  cannot moving out of the organization so  health domain also starting look at this  you know i've been interviewed a couple  of times by their health magazines they  also believe that the ads are going to  change them significantly so those are  the factors uh the interesting thing is  i don't expect that all these industry  sectors will be moving at the same path  you know same it you know it's dependent  on the way how uh how the  how they realize it is important for for  their  business right i think for them business  number one and but i do see all two  manufacturers and those and then  particularly smart home you know  in this areas that there is a lot of you  know  uh  ongoing things a smart home you already  see we it's gonna be a penetration to  our life you didn't really realize that  for example many of these  uh the smart home gateways today are  doing edge computing for you now but you  just haven't realized that so yeah  that's great  all right well i guess we know we could  talk all day but we're um  we're out of time now so thanks again we  sangshi for all of your time today and  thanks to everyone who's uh joined us uh  make sure you give us feedback in our  survey and visit us at horizon.mit  for all the latest on emerging  technologies  and we hope to see you at the next event  thanks again thank you for having me  yeah absolutely our pleasure  [Music]  you  so  [Music]  my  let's get into the big topic of open  source something that we actually  cultured  what  let's say has is kubernetes ecosystem  really boom  [Music]  welcome to another episode of in the  cloud i am your host stu miniman and we  could say that this episode is going to  be out of this world yes we are going to  be talking about a special edge  computing project uh on the  international space station something  that ibm and red hat work together on uh  obviously uh many of us in tech are are  space enthusiasts uh so uh i  for one am really excited to be able to  talk about it it's a really a great  example of what ikt can do when when  teams have reliable infrastructure uh in  the software to go along with it uh  there's actually there's a reason why  red hat has a new brand campaign so uh  if you watch television especially if  you watch sports you might see uh this  new advertisement that we are  going to share with you here uh quick  30-second ad and then we will be back uh  with the program so uh please enjoy  this advertise  test commencing  good code should work anywhere even in  outer space  water safety test commencing in five  when we know our apps will work in any  environment my team can focus on our  code  we did an extra round of debugging right  yep the code is clean okay here we go  everybody  houston  water analysis was a success  [Music]  this is what connecting your clouds  feels like  awesome so uh you know as i mentioned uh  before that uh you know space activity  uh when i look at cloud computing what  we've been doing at red hat with  openshift uh we talk about having our  code run anywhere edge computing of  course has been uh a big effort to be  able to  make the footprint fit and talk about uh  you know some of the some of the  challenges you know edge computing we're  going to the far edge when we go to  something like the international station  so i'm really happy to welcome to the  program our guest for today is naim  altif he is an ibm distinguished  engineer and he's also the chief  technology officer for space tech naeem  thank you so much for joining us and uh  gotta say i i love this the space setup  that you've got behind uh next to you  there with you know the rockets and  satellites and the likes uh thanks so  much for joining us  thank you so much for having me all  right so so name uh you're a  distinguished engineer at ibm so you  know distinguished engineers and fellows  you know these are people that have you  know broad experiences and done a lot um  tell us a little bit about your journey  to space tech i mean you you weren't you  know somebody started out you're for  more of the software side so help us  understand a little bit your journey as  to how you got to today  sure so like you mentioned like uh we  all in the you know technology sector  weird space enthusiast many of us are  so i think few years ago i got the  opportunity to work at the seti  institute as a volunteer we were working  on some interesting projects  and from there i got this you know  visibility where as you know most of the  industry today is going software defined  so like you said i don't have a you know  aerospace background i'm a computer  scientist uh so it's like okay you know  programming is everywhere code is  everywhere so it means that we can also  be in this uh in this sector so that's  how i got interested and started  learning about what are the different  segments in this space where vs software  developers can play in  and that's how you know all these ideas  came into picture and we'll discuss more  about these things  yeah so uh you're at ibm of course ibm  deals with companies not only around the  globe but now now you're dealing with  solutions in space so bring us  help set the table for us you know  working with nasa what was nasa looking  to do how did ibm get involved what were  some of the you know the challenges that  that that they pulled  you and the team uh into  sure  so uh  when we started looking at uh you know  what interesting things we can do in in  space so right now the buzz in the  industry as you know from we went from  cloud computing now in in the era of  edge computing and the idea was how can  we extend this edge computing into the  orbit in space and uh the target was  international space station  international space station as you know  is a laboratory for many many  experiments happening there  and we we can judge  we know we have we know the  communications we have on terrestrial  networks if you are at some forward  location you have latency you know  bandwidth challenges if you're in space  those magnify those challenges so we  reached out to space station national  labs and nasa and we like okay what kind  of projects you're running there which  are  heavy on compute  heavy on data  so you can do some match computing for  you  and the project which they mentioned was  one of the projects was dna sequencing  and they mentioned that you know it  creates almost half a terabyte of data  on each one and now that data has to be  you know brought down to the uh to the  ground through through the ground  stations and the way  you know just a bit of background uh  when you are in the low earth orbit  which where the space station is around  i think 250 miles up or kilometers up  you are moving at 17 000 miles per hour  so your touch point with a ground  station any given ground station is only  seven minutes and you're talking about a  radio frequency so you know there are  several bands but you're not talking  about gigabits of transmission  so in space station in the any satellite  in the lower earth orbit if it wants a  much more frequent uplink downlinks it  actually goes up to the geostationary  flap satellites and nasa has a  constellation of them for the data relay  so the data goes from the space station  up in the geo stationary orbit and from  there it comes down to the ground  station  and the reason for that is if you have  dish at home like dish network or drink  whatever you know you have  you probably have noticed once you put  the dish at your home you don't have to  go out and keep on moving the dish  because earth is rotating satellites in  geostationary orbit the satellites are  in mo in exact motion of how the earth  is revolving so that's why you have  these dishes which can point to your  telecommunication satellites so that's  how it works from the space station goes  up and comes down  so while we were uh  working with them so we started how  about if we uh  perform this computation on the space  station so we work with the uh you know  with the nasa try to understand you know  what needs to be done and it's a it's a  bit complex uh  uh you know  uh  problem because uh when you're talking  about dna sequencing there are multiple  steps involved you have base scaling you  have the demultiplexing you have the  alignment and then you have a general  report so we took that code we  containerized that code and we wanted to  get the openshift platform we want to  put the containers in space so at that  time two years ago we had the code ready  container from the uh from red hat  openshift which could fit on the single  node so we took that code  we containerized all the code and we  didn't put this uh it actually went up  last year in april  uh so and since then we have like three  or four runs so basically it's running  in production now and and again the goal  was  minimize the downlink you don't want to  downlink half a terabyte now for example  when the report is generated  it's literally one meg file  so so again so you did all this  computation there and because the  principal investigators who are  requesting  this run  they just want a resulting file they  don't care about all this raw data and  right so and and  and and the genesis of this project was  uh  they're looking for  microbes inside the space station so  basically the astronauts they take a  sample from the surface of the space  station and they run through this device  which generates all the data and we pick  it up from there and generate the final  report  so these has huge implications for the  future for example  you know we are hearing a lot about you  know probably watching the rtms program  going back to the moon the sls is  already on the pad to go up right  uh for the uh  and then you're going to the mars and  and you know for all these deep space  missions  imagine you have these robots and you  have these uh dna sequencer these  devices so these robots just like how  mars does a mars robot does right rover  it goes and it pokes into the ground to  pick up the sample so what if it would  pick the sample and it has a dna  sequencer there and it can run through  the sequencing and  it maybe it can find life somewhere  so that's the whole idea about edge  computing and edge computing in space  yeah no it's it's it's fascinating uh  when you look at this uh it's  one of the patterns we look at for  artificial intelligence often  you might do  your training at a centralized location  like often the cloud is where you need  to kind of build the models but you need  to be able to deploy  where i'm at the data source is so the  example we've used in the industry for a  long time is  you know if you look at cars  if i have a car and it has a lidar i  can't wait to go back to a public cloud  because i will have hit  you know  the thing before i get the data back  space  you know absolutely is is a phenomenal  example of that um as you say just on  the iss there's limited bandwidth but  right if i'm going to the moon if i'm  going to mars if i need to be able to  analyze data or you know maybe look at  certain safety concerns where i would be  testing things that would be so  important to be able to do that locally  um question for you you talk about the  maturity of kubernetes you worked with  our team at red hat um  we spent a lot of time over the last  couple of years  shrinking the footprint and the amount  of resources there so  maybe you could talk to a little bit the  intersection of the requirements that  they had and uh the the maturation of  the technology to reach uh you know the  successful solution  sure no so that was a and it's a great  uh partnership with the redhead and uh  and shout out to the team you know at  the crc and we'll talk about the micro  shift as well so there so the goal was  to reduce the  enterprise uh open shift version to a  single node two years ago which i know  it exists today  so so that was the initial goal  then from there the next step was okay  how can we shrink even further because  when we are talking about edge computing  devices we are talking about devices  like uh  raspberry pi  stuff like that can we have a version of  an open shift which can fit on this  device and we can you know  and also beyond you know besides these  uh versions of open shift  we also have as you know apartment to  run the containers so we are using a  combination of we how it fits where we  use portman what is the lighter weight  of the uh you know the uh open shift so  that's how we know we work together  because the uh the target needs for we  need a  lightweight platform because the  footprint of hardware is not as big as  you can you know expect on the  industrial networks so that drove all  these uh requirements with the team and  uh it was a great experience working  with other team  all right one of the other concerns also  is you know do i have the skill set to  be able to take care of things so how  many red hat and ibm people did we send  to the iss to be able to set up you know  configure and manage this whole  environment  this  one  did we actually have uh have an employee  from uh uh up on the iss or you know  what was it somebody that was trained  no no so we have the uh actually we have  access to the systems from the ground so  we were able to like ssh into the  systems and basically the flight systems  were built here in alabama so we  uploaded everything over there wrapped  up system and once it went up and it  took like couple of months to go live at  that point we were able to go and you  know start the uh the whole sequence  so uh but at this point i mean minimal  right i mean the initially with ibm  engineer redhead engineer i'm making  sure the system is all prepped before it  launches and after that it's just a  matter of running the script  yeah um  yeah that's phenomenal and that that's  the you want it to be able to manage  things you know out of that but you you  don't want to have to have the resource  touch there automation needs to be  involved you know remote management all  that sort of sort of stuff um what else  anything else we should know about you  know the kubernetes solution uh on the  space station  no so like you hit the right point  fully automated that's the key thing  because you you have like  at any given time between three to four  astronauts on the on the space station  and there  every minute is scheduled i mean i have  seen those uh schedules i was in the iss  uh headquarters in dc and i was just  surprised to see up to a minute that  they will do this they will they will  sleep for this minute they will eat now  it's like everything is scheduled for  weeks  so so we had to make sure that the  platform we put in can fully because  like i mentioned there are multiple  steps involved it's a complicated  process so we need a platform which can  take care of which is resilient and you  know in case of any failure it can go  back and start so we shouldn't have to  ask somebody  whether on this space station or on the  ground station at the nasa to go and  trigger this again a fully automated  process  that's awesome um you mentioned uh  microshift so uh for those that aren't  familiar micro shift is currently a open  source project uh to be able to take uh  you know when we had  open shift uh we can do a single node um  of of openshift so kubernetes on a  single server but  there's still you know a minimum  requirement for how much resources are  available microshift actually isn't full  kubernetes there's some things we need  to strip out we need to be able to make  it to fit on a smaller footprint so  where's  where's microshift intersecting with uh  with what you're looking at  on the space programs  so so that's a good good question so  our goal is to  introduce a  containerized platform for the space  industry and as you mentioned right  there there are a lot of uh restraints  here because of the the footprint of the  compute  so actually uh  there's a there's a very uh  i think the only conference for the  small set category which happens every  year in utah and we just submitted which  got accepted so this summer we will be  actually presented presenting microshift  to the developer community of the  satellite and it's a huge community and  we want to introduce them that as you  are building schools universities and  the small set programs take a look at  this platform which we will talk about  what we are doing in future with this  platform on our mission but uh but  that's the idea right i mean uh make it  available to the developers  and let them play with it and see how  they can you know orchestrate from their  different kinds of workloads because  the thing thing about this are  the  the data centers we have on the ground  today  these data centers are planning to move  in the orbit yeah it sounds like little  bit but but that is true they want to  move these data centers in the orbit so  you will have basically a cloud will be  running in the orbit so all the things  which we care about the multi-tenancy  right how can the platforms handle  multiple workloads the uh sas kind of  solutions they all will be going into  the space we just have to be  we can't just go over there physically  and do some things you have to keep that  in mind while we are developing these  systems and solutions  yeah i i had too many years uh you know  watching the data center space the thing  that comes to mind is like well cooling  should be less of an issue in space  because we should be able to  you know vent out heat rather than uh  we're worrying about uh other things  there um yeah but maybe we speak a  little bit about the endurance mission  and the cube satellites and where people  can learn more about that  sure  so uh when we started uh looking into  the uh you know into the space area one  was one thing was to uh  how can we also launch our satellite and  this is purely for research and  educational purposes  and uh so so we started working on that  and we wanted to use the latest and  greatest technology available  among us ibm and red hat and at that  time micro shift was still in very it's  a it was a thought process right so  we've worked with the team over the year  and finally we have open source version  of micro shift actually this will be  launching on june 1st net 30 which means  you know because of the weather it can  get delayed few days but the target is  the june 1st the largest cubesat which  will be uh  which will be running on raspberry pi  and the idea over here is  as i was going through the process of  how can we put a satellite if you do a  look for a checklist  it is huge and for right reasons because  you know it you have to go through so  many steps and approvals and i mean if  you you guys can just google nasa 101  cubesat and you will see this like 200  page book guidelines which tells you you  have to follow all these steps so i was  like okay if if we're living in these uh  uh you know modern part of the world it  is so hard imagine the developing  nations or underdeveloped countries  across the globe it will be almost next  to impossible for them to launch  something or have access so the goal was  okay we will launch this thing and we  will make it available to every school  kid on the planet it will be available  so uh so right now we are starting with  ibm ptek program which is the schools  they work with all over the globe and  i think the uh the link is shared so so  schools can register and we will be we  will give them the apis everything they  can write their code in python and they  will be able to submit the code and the  code will actually go on the uh on the  cubesat execute there  and and come back there are variety of  sensors on this cubesat from  you know from all the positioning  there's like i think 20 different  metrics for positioning vector you have  the uh all the metrics played for the  battery for operational point of view  you have the metrics for the solar  panels you have the the heat information  then you have the  compute over there where we can use  commands like you know like nmon we will  have podman there we will have  microshift there we have ai binaries  there so we can  detect you know because you have a  camera on the cubesat so it can go and  detect stuff so we have variety of  sensors variety of metrics which your  code can play with and do some edge  computing computation  and then once you one last thing  once you uh execute the code and the  results come back we will issue you a  certificate which will be uh created by  basically the stamped by quantum  computer you know the number you get  will be quantum community generated  yeah naima you know i i know i was  excited when uh  you know i could have my name uh you  know on something that was like  going up in a rocket and like nasa send  you a little certificate but what you  described there you know so many home  enthusiasts  you grab a raspberry pi it has centers i  can do that but  you're removing the hardware and it's in  space so how cool is that the kids get  to play with this they get there i i  would hope that this will you know just  increase people's interest in stem uh  you know we we need you know globally to  be looking at uh you know the the the  the opportunities of space so uh that is  that is so awesome uh to see the  activity um you know something we expect  you know a company like ibm to be  involved with so it's great to get back  on that um  you know  you talk about how everything gets all  planned out um you know i i watched  lately it's like up well you know we  have the rough date as to when the iss  will you know be decommissioned and come  down so um what can you tell us about  you know future activities you know  are we planning for future space  stations are there other you know  projects that that you can share that uh  you know ibm and red hat are involved in  like cool  yes so i mean space station has been  amazing right and it's coming end of  life at 20 30. and actually you know  there is a there is a graveyard selected  for where it will go in the ocean it's  the west of australia right that was  really cool i learned recently about  that so so now as space station is you  know uh  coming coming down our end of life there  are news companies who are emerging  because this is what has happened in  last couple of years and uh  and a huge you know uh stuff which uh  the industry which has been changed is  by of course by spacex what they have  done so basically the  the commercial and the private sector is  coming together with the government  sector right they're opening up and you  will see there is a  there is a flight going up tomorrow  right uh ax1  for the private astronauts to go on  space station then there is the crew 4  going end of this month so i mean again  going to the space station  but now since the uh the private sector  has  you know come forward there are  many companies like i think there are  three or four who got the awards to put  these space stations the next nursing  space station  so if you think about the space station  if you think about insight it you know  it has lots of sensors it has lots of  research equipment inside where they're  doing research for microgravity for  you know looking growing plants the food  stuff i mean watching the health of the  astronauts and doing you know a lot of  imagery from on the planet all that kind  of stuff but inside to do all those  things you need you need id  infrastructure you need compute storage  and network and that's what these  companies are you know we are in  discussions with few and talking about  okay what will be the  next generation  platform which is the whole stack right  your uh your infrastructure your  platform your tasks your sas the whole  stack how will that fit in that uh space  station  and then you know the rules will be a  bit different how you interact with  basically the idea is the space stations  will become because they want to  commercialize this stuff so they will  become like labs right so you have  different kinds of experiments you want  to run so you're on the ground and you  know a cloud of your choice and you know  from their cloud you say you know i want  to access something i want to run some  experiment on that given space station  so that also brings in the picture of  this ai sec  devops you can add so many  acronyms right so the whole pipeline  basically so that is a huge uh  discussion okay how can we build these  pipelines where users can build their  code and that's where you know the uh  the cool thing about openshift is you  you write once you can push your code  anywhere and that's our messaging is  that we have a  we have a platform whether you're in  your data center or you are in some  somewhere in the cloud or you are at the  edge somewhere on the test network or  your edge happens to be in space your  underlying platform is the same so me as  a developer while i'm  writing my code when i push my code it  doesn't matter whether it's called in  space edge on the ground because the  platform underlying is the same so so  that's one area the other area is how do  we build these pipelines to push and  then the transmission  there are challenges the network you  know the disruption between  in the orbit how do we make sure that  it's resilient that whatever i pushed to  this far edge  it's the same thing if it did not got  compromised especially when we are  talking about the uh  machine learning models it's very very  sensitive you know because you're  relying on the output of those models so  you want to make sure the model which  you developed is the same model which is  running over there  so yeah these are all the different  things i mean you will think about the  platforms for software development the  your data pipelines how you're going to  push security is huge  area how you're going to secure the  communications  so and this is basically data center is  now going from the terrestrial into the  space yeah and even i i think about you  know public cloud architecture name when  you talked about you know the  geosynchronous orbit you know do you  expect to see a public cloud announcing  a region uh you know  on the geosynchronous satellites because  it's probably still going to be a little  bit while uh before they have an  availability zone on on the moon so you  know with the geosynchronous orbit be  the first place that you know i might  have certain cloud services available  there  most probably in the low earth orbit and  the reason is the companies are talking  about putting a constellation so you  have a ring of let's say you put six or  eight of these  mini data centers  and they will be connected through  optical connections in a ring and then  based on that you can write information  among each other and push down whoever  has the best site to get to the ground  station so i think definitely we will  see these uh edge locations in space  in few years  wow um it was interesting i attended uh  back in 2019 when we still had physical  events amazon held a conference that was  uh you know space was a big piece of it  and i i geeked out i went to a whole  bunch of sessions and i talked to some  friends and i was like oh i wish i was  in the space industry and they're like  stu compared to the i.t industry the  space industry actually moves kind of  slow so i'm wondering if you know you've  got a great viewpoint of this you talk  about all the planning you talk about  the 200 pages you know  today's day you know i i want to be able  to respond fast spin things up do  instant so  where do you see kind of space and i.t  intersecting when it comes to  the path of innovation  i think on the  on the on the uh development of physical  infrastructure it's going to be slow  because you only have one shot  and that's why you know i mean in space  industry one launch failure you're  almost  you're out of luck your company is done  so that part is hard to  move faster but the things which will  move is faster is the software defined  and that's what we are trying to focus  okay you know yes you you guys are  expert in building these spacecraft  satellites we are expert in the you know  on the software side how can we come  together to create these software  defined satellites  again think about it the the challenge  of solving data on the on the ground i  think this is far more advanced than the  type of data you will have in space i  mean think about you know all the social  media the amount of traffic flows  through networks every day you don't  have that much traffic so i think we  have pretty good idea of how we can  build these kind of platforms which are  resilient now the challenge is how we  can fit those in a smaller tighter space  that's the challenge and this and the  industry is moving towards courts course  means you know compute off the shelf so  before it used to be proprietary fpgas  stuff like that but now it's opening up  because there are companies who are  building these uh enclosures which can  protect from radiation radiation is the  biggest thing  to protect your computer from so so they  will be like radiation hardened  enclosures where a compute can your  regular compute can sit in and it can do  stuff  right so uh so these are some challenges  but i think that the aspect of software  defined for the space industry that will  speed up things  yeah um  i i'm curious you you live down down in  the austin area and we've seen you know  texas just seems to be the hotbed uh for  you know space uh you know these days um  yet in the last two years a lot of the  stuff has gone remote so  you know speak a little bit if you could  too you know what's happening in texas  versus you know the global participation  uh in all of the space activity like  your team is it you know is it a  globally uh dispersed group or you know  or is is there a core team you know  in one of the ibm locations  so these days you know everybody is in  remote locations because of you know the  pandemic or last two three years so the  core is team is in austin texas but we  have participants from almost all over  the world because you know we we have a  thing called in ibm uh the academy of  technology where you go and create  initiatives and people worldwide join  try to help you to build those different  kinds of solutions so it's a family and  we also had participants from the red  hat of course so we all working whoever  can contribute from wherever they are in  their capacity  so that's where uh you know how we are  working now if you talk about you know  what's happening in this region right so  you know we have uh  boca chica right has a very cool name in  in south texas over here we have  starship right and probably guys saw in  last year when they did their test with  starship so i think that is uh  we are very looking forward to that when  actually the starship launch happens  and a huge and a lot of things are  happening  you know they're talking about building  the uh the next generation of spaceport  here in the uh  in the south but that will also bring  modernization of your command and  control data centers and that's where  again our platforms our technology will  come in so there's a lot of room as  software developers  uh with little or no space background  all week all we want is your uh  enthusiasm and your you know  your curiosity about space i think  there's plenty of room well  i guess that that that's a great setup  for my my final question is you know  where what are the skill sets that that  people are looking for um for those  people that work in tech that are  enthused you know  what are people hiring for what what are  the areas where uh you know that there's  real need to be able to uh you know i  might not be the person getting on the  rocket um but i can help uh you know  build the technologies around uh what's  happening there  sure  again let's i mean just just to look at  the uh the recent examples right so look  at how the  the booster comes down that's pure  programming how it's coming down you  know  that that's just you know amazing to  watch it's sometimes it looks like  you're watching a movie and then you saw  when the uh the uh dragon which took the  first  uh crew to the space station you saw the  consoles right the linux space or  windows based consoles inside so yeah as  long as you know hardcore programmers  there is plenty of opportunities and  then if you have you know again if you  want to be in this aerospace or space  industry you need to understand a bit  more about how the dynamics works here  in the space you need to have some ideas  about  and but if you are a good programmer i  don't see you know how you can fit here  because they need lots and lots of  programmers  awesome well name thank you so much for  sharing uh we we definitely uh we we've  got a chat group here at red hat that  you know watches all the space flights  and uh really is interested and you know  a great collaboration between ibm and  red hat to make these solutions work so  thank you so much for joining us  thank you so much my pleasure  all right so uh hope you enjoyed this  special uh session uh about space you  know definitely a topic uh i i'd love to  hear uh hear plenty about uh just  programming note uh we will not have the  program two weeks from now we will be  back uh in four weeks we've got a lot  coming out uh if if you look at red hat  red hat summit uh is happening there in  may so look for lots of announcements um  you can join the event it is a hybrid  event and registration is open so uh  thank you so much for joining us uh for  your journey in the clouds i'm stu  miniman we'll see you back in four weeks  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  you
